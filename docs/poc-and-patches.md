# PoC & Patch Delivery

How auditor-skill turns a confirmed finding into an executable exploit and a verified fix patch. Back to the [docs index](README.md).

A finding is *asserted* by the Rule 5b gate (reachability + math/state-bounds, + attacker-model at ≥7). A **PoC** upgrades it to *demonstrated*; a **patch** proposes and proves the fix. Neither invents a finding — Rule 5b must have confirmed it first. Commands: [`/auditor:poc`](commands.md#auditorpoc), [`/auditor:patch`](commands.md#auditorpatch). Agents: [poc-engineer, patch-engineer](agents.md#poc-engineer). Reference: [`references/orchestration/poc-harness.md`](../references/orchestration/poc-harness.md).

## The one rule

> **Executable evidence outranks prose, but prose is never removed.**

An unbuildable or un-forkable target still yields a complete finding — you downgrade the **evidence tier**, never the **severity**. A named blocker with the prose PoC intact is honest; a fabricated green test is not. This principle governs every tier below.

```

The crate the `poc-engineer` fills is copied from `templates/poc/`; the patch templates from `templates/patch/`. `run.sh` builds each arm to SBF and runs its test (both arms compile to the same `.so`, so they can't coexist — it builds, tests, overwrites), and exits non-zero if the exploit doesn't reproduce on `vulnerable` or isn't blocked on `fixed`.

## `--with-poc` vs on-demand

- **On demand:** run `/auditor:poc <finding-id>` then `/auditor:patch <finding-id>` for a specific finding. Default runs produce PoCs only this way, so baseline audit cost is unchanged.
- **`/auditor:audit-cycle --with-poc`:** after reconciliation, the flow spawns `poc-engineer` on every confirmed **N≥7** finding → `audit_<n>/poc/F-xxx/`, then `patch-engineer` → `audit_<n>/patches/F-xxx.patch` + `VERIFICATION.md`, recording both tiers in the report's finding block.

By default only **High/Critical (N≥7)** findings earn an executable PoC (a runnable exploit is the Rule 5b proof those severities want; spending the harness budget on low-severity items is waste). `--force` overrides the gate. A finding still at `[UNCONFIRMED]`/`[PARTIAL]` is **not** eligible — confirm it through Rule 5b first.

## Framework selection

`/auditor:poc` detects the toolchain (never assumes), then picks the cheapest harness that faithfully reproduces the bug.

| Finding type | Harness | Success tier |
|--------------|---------|--------------|
| logic / access-control / signer / owner / PDA / CPI-target / arithmetic in **one instruction** | **Mollusk** (single `process_instruction`) — fastest, deterministic, in-process | `[PoC-REPRODUCED]` |
| **multi-step lifecycle** — init → mutate → withdraw; reinit; close → revival; cross-instruction state | **LiteSVM** stateful sequence | `[PoC-REPRODUCED]` |
| **economic / oracle / MEV / first-depositor** — value depends on live pool/oracle state or ordering | **Surfpool mainnet-fork** (`--fork`) — deposit→manipulate→withdraw for a real P/L | `[PoC-SIM-REPRODUCED]` |
| **parse / deser / math** that is fuzz-discoverable | **Trident** stateful (default) or **cargo-fuzz** unit (`--fuzz`) — let the fuzzer find the input | `[PoC-FUZZ-REPRODUCED]` |
| **off-chain** TS/Rust client, indexer, keeper, backend | cargo-fuzz / vitest / proptest on the off-chain code | `[PoC-FUZZ-REPRODUCED]` or `[PoC-REPRODUCED]` |

`--fork` / `--fuzz` force the Surfpool / fuzz path when the finding type is ambiguous. Escalation discipline: a stateful Trident sequence is the primary bug-finder for non-trivial programs — proptest-on-pure-functions is a cheap first probe, not the destination; and skip FV entirely when the outcome is decided by a CPI into untrusted code (mock that boundary adversarially in Trident instead).

## Toolchain requirements

| Gate | Detect | Enables | If absent |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|
| **`cargo build-sbf`** — platform-tools **≥ v1.54** / cargo ≥ 1.85 | `cargo build-sbf --version` | Mollusk **and** LiteSVM (both load a compiled `.so`) | `[PoC-ATTEMPTED]`, keep prose. "install Agave platform-tools ≥ v1.54" |
| **Surfpool** (CLI + MCP) | `surfpool --version`; MCP reachable | mainnet-fork economic/oracle/MEV with a real P/L | fall back to Mollusk/LiteSVM if modelable, else `[PoC-ATTEMPTED]` |
| **Trident** | `trident --version` | coverage-guided multi-instruction fuzzing | try `cargo fuzz`; else prose → `[PoC-ATTEMPTED]` |
| **cargo-fuzz** | `cargo fuzz --version` | fuzz a single pure function | hand-written failing unit test on the boundary; else `[PoC-ATTEMPTED]` |

> The default `cargo-build-sbf` bundle is platform-tools **v1.51 / cargo 1.84**, which **cannot** parse the `edition2024` manifests in the modern `mollusk-svm`/`litesvm` dep tree. `run.sh` pins `--tools-version v1.54` (cargo ≥ 1.85) to build the graph with no dependency edits; override via `TOOLS_VERSION=...`. Build/toolchain failures are troubleshooting, not findings — resolve via [`references/framework-idioms/build-and-tooling.md`](../references/framework-idioms/build-and-tooling.md).

## Evidence tiers (PoC)

Award the **highest tier the available tooling actually reached**, then stop. Each rung is a real, reportable finding; the ladder degrades gracefully to prose.

| Tier | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `[PoC-REPRODUCED]` | Mollusk/LiteSVM executed the exploit: **succeeds on `vulnerable`, rejected on `fixed`**. Deterministic. Gold standard. |
| `[PoC-SIM-REPRODUCED]` | Reproduced on a Surfpool mainnet-fork with a recorded net **P/L** (economic/oracle/MEV). |
| `[PoC-FUZZ-REPRODUCED]` | A Trident/cargo-fuzz target produced the crashing/invariant-breaking input; the corpus/crash artifact is saved. |
| `[PoC-ATTEMPTED]` | A required tool was absent, or the flaw couldn't be minimized into a self-contained crate. Name the exact blocker, **keep the prose PoC**, record what a maintainer must install. Severity unchanged. |
| `[PoC-PROSE]` | Structured attacker-narrative only (actor → capability → numbered steps → guard bypassed → quantified outcome). The accepted default for access-control/logic findings — a first-class Rule 5b proof form. |

The exploit test must **assert** the vulnerability (`assert_exploit_succeeds!` on `vulnerable`, `assert_exploit_rejected!` on `fixed`) — a test that compiles and runs but doesn't assert the flaw is not a PoC. **Never fabricate a passing test to climb the ladder.**

## Fix tiers (patch)

After a PoC exists, `/auditor:patch` proposes a minimal idiomatic diff against the pinned commit that closes *exactly* the cited bound — no refactor, no drive-by cleanup — obeying the Rust/Anchor/Pinocchio rules (checked arithmetic, stored canonical bumps, `transfer_checked` not `transfer`, no `unwrap()`/`expect()` in program code, validated CPI targets). It applies the diff to a **scratch git worktree** (never the client tree), rebuilds, and re-runs the finding's PoC.

| Tier | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `[FIX-VERIFIED]` | Diff applied to a scratch worktree, rebuilt, and the finding's PoC **re-ran and now reverts** — closure shown by execution. Optional `mewt` mutation / blast-radius clean. |
| `[FIX-INSUFFICIENT]` | The diff doesn't fully close the bound: the PoC still exploits a residual path, a mutant survives on the patched line, or an adjacent path regressed. State exactly what remains open. |
| `[FIX-PROPOSED]` | A minimal idiomatic diff re-derived from the code closes the cited bound, but **no executable PoC was available** to run the revert. Verified by reasoning, flagged not-yet-executed. |

The patch is a **proposal, not an application** — the auditor stays read-only on the client's real tree and hands back the diff + `VERIFICATION.md`. **A cosmetic patch ≠ FIXED:** never claim `[FIX-VERIFIED]` without an *executed* revert of the finding's own exploit. `--verify-with-mutation` runs `mewt` mutation on the patched line (a surviving mutant means the guard is under-tested) plus a `differential-review` blast-radius check (a fix that breaks an adjacent instruction is `[FIX-INSUFFICIENT]`). The fix tier feeds the report's **Auditor Verification** field.

## Where it sits in the flow

1. Rule 5b confirms the finding ([output-and-rigor.md](output-and-rigor.md#the-rule-5b-validation-gate)).
2. `/auditor:poc` → detect gates → pick framework → `poc-engineer` fills `templates/poc/` → `run.sh` → award the highest tier reached.
3. `/auditor:patch` → `patch-engineer` writes the `templates/patch/` diff → apply to a scratch worktree → re-run the PoC → award a fix tier.
4. `/auditor:audit-cycle` / `/auditor:re-audit` fold both tiers back into the finding block; the report's **Auditor Verification** line carries the fix verdict.
