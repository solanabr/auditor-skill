## Scoping

### `/auditor:intake`
Alias `/scope`. **Arg:** `[path] [--auto]`
Turns the passive `QUESTIONS.md` questionnaire into a persisted `audit_<n>/intake.md` — the durable intake artifact both `/auditor:audit-cycle` and `/auditor:audit-assist` read (fixes intake living only in conversation state). Pins the commit (`git rev-parse HEAD`), pre-fills languages/framework/monorepo shape from what the code shows, warms from prior audits via `audit-mem warm` if the tools are built, and captures scope, protocol class, compliance, severity calibration, and the trust-model inputs (who holds admin / upgrade authority / oracle / keeper / LP, and what the review trusts them NOT to do).
**When:** before any serious audit. **Emits:** `audit_<n>/intake.md`.
`--auto` records the applied default for every unanswered question (no-human pipelines); interactive mode asks sharp, answerable questions and skips what the repo already answers. It also asks once for the **execution mode** (`Q46`: isolated recommended / native — `OUTPUT-RULES.md` Rule 11a); `--auto` records native as an assumed default, and the report states it.

### `/auditor:threat-model`
**Arg:** `[path] [--auto] [--bootstrap] [--vulns <file|https-url>] [--seed <threat-model.md>] [--design-doc <file>] [--parent <https-url|path>]`
Builds the pre-review threat model *before* verdicts (analogous to how context reconstruction precedes verdicts): an **asset inventory** (crown-jewel funds/authority/data and where they live), an **actor × capability table** (each actor → what it can do → what it must NOT be able to do — the load-bearing column), and a **trust-boundary map** (every CPI, caller-supplied account, instruction arg, `remaining_accounts`, sysvar that crosses into higher trust, with whether it is validated). Ends with **attacker goals to test** (`AG-n`, each with an Evidence cell), mapped to the checklists/vectors that hunt them.
**When:** after intake + context, before the manual review. **Emits:** `audit_<n>/threat-model.md` (seeds report §4.4/§4.6/§4.7), plus `audit_<n>/bootstrap/` in bootstrap mode.
No verdicts, no severities — target enumeration only. `--auto` drives the `threat-modeler` agent; interactive asks the human. **`--bootstrap`** (also implied by `--vulns` / `--seed` / `--parent`, and auto-selected offline when intake records a prior audit or incident, a fork is detected, or prior audits / incidents sit next to the target) runs the bundled `<auditor-skill root>/scripts/threat-model/collect.sh` first (never a `scripts/` path relative to the audited repo): keyword commits, reverts, removed and quietly added account guards, churn, an optional fork-parent comparison, and prior audit reports (PDF/MD), post-mortems, lists and `INCIDENTS.json`. Network only for an `https://` URL the user passes in `--parent` / `--vulns`, even with `--auto`; automatic trigger runs stay offline and record a detected parent as not cloned. Interactively it drafts first, then interviews the team. Method: [threat-model-bootstrap.md](../references/audit-lifecycle/threat-model-bootstrap.md). Every claim cites `file:line` or its evidence; banned words → `UNKNOWN — needs manual review`.

## Review

### `/auditor:audit`
**Arg:** `[path] [--scope full|program|backend|frontend]`
Full scope-gated audit end-to-end in one session: reads `OUTPUT-RULES.md`, follows `FULL-AUDIT.md` with scope-gated loading, spawns `context-builder` → `vuln-hunter` → `economic-analyst` → `audit-reporter`. Every in-scope item + phase-triggered vector gets `[PASS]`/`[FAIL-N]`/`[PARTIAL]`/`[N/A]`; N≥6 findings pass Rule 5b or downgrade.
**When:** whole-repo audit where you handle triage yourself. **Emits:** `audit_<n>/REPORT.md` (internal template, numeric risk score) with executive summary, Scope Coverage table, findings, Phase 4.5 maturity scorecard, remediation roadmap.
Uses ToB tooling if present, else the grep scanners (noting the gap).

### `/auditor:quick-scan`
**Arg:** (none)
Fast triage: discovery + scope + static analysis (ToB `static-analysis` if present, else `discovery/grep-commands.md`) + only CRITICAL/HIGH known-vectors for the detected domains — not the full set.
**When:** first look, CI gate (on a public repo: pass/fail only, no counts — Rule 11d). **Emits:** findings with severity + `file:line`; explicitly states it is a triage pass and points to `/auditor:audit`.

### `/auditor:deep-review`
**Arg:** `<file> [function|instruction]`
Deep single-unit review: read the file, run Phase 0.5 context reconstruction on the target (purpose, inputs, ≥3 invariants, ≥5 assumptions, ≥3 external-interaction risks, each cited to `L#`), fill the instruction worksheet, cross-reference shared-state code, adversarially model exploitation.
**When:** one handler/endpoint/function needs depth. **Emits:** per-item verdicts + findings for that unit only. N≥6 findings pass Rule 5b.

### `/auditor:diff-audit`
**Arg:** `[base..head | PR number]`
Differential audit (Mode 4). Changed set via `git diff --name-only base..head` (default `main..HEAD`); Phase 0.5 on changed functions + 1-hop callers/callees; risk-classify (auth/crypto/value-transfer/validation-removal = HIGH); git-blame removed security code (deletion in a "fix"/"CVE" commit = CRITICAL regression); run only the matching checklist items + vectors through Rule 5b. When a manifest or lockfile changed, a **dependency lane** runs checklist 11 §11.11 (the published artifact's code delta, SC-059..062) and adds a Dependency delta section.
**When:** a PR / commit range, not the whole tree. **Emits:** `audit_<n>/PR-REPORT.md` — changed-surface verdicts only; skips whole-repo discovery.

### `/auditor:spec-audit`
**Arg:** `<spec-file> [program-path]`
Spec-compliance (Mode 5). Extract a requirement list (Spec-IR) from the spec; Phase 0 + Phase 0.5; map each instruction/state field to the spec's stated behavior; build a **Compliance Matrix** — each requirement → `[MET]` / `[VIOLATED-N]` / `[UNIMPLEMENTED]` / `[UNDOCUMENTED-BEHAVIOR]`, cited to code `L#`.
**When:** a spec / whitepaper / RFC is supplied. **Emits:** the Compliance Matrix + findings. `[VIOLATED-N≥6]` passes Rule 5b; `[UNDOCUMENTED-BEHAVIOR]` (code the spec never authorizes) is itself a finding.

### `/auditor:audit-cycle`
**Arg:** `[path] [--scope full|program|backend|frontend]` (+ `--with-poc`)
**Flow A — fully automated audit team.** Runs the whole lifecycle autonomously (scope → context → threat model → tool-assisted pass → domain-partitioned review → triage → independent reconciliation → synthesis) with no human; applies `QUESTIONS.md` defaults and records each assumption.
**When:** hands-off engagement → deliverable. **Emits:** the **client-facing** `audit_<n>/REPORT.md` (maturity narrative + trust-model caveats + disclaimers, **no deploy guarantee**), optional PDF, `harnesses/` if any were generated, and — with `--with-poc` — `poc/` + `patches/` for confirmed N≥7. Full detail: [audit-flows.md](audit-flows.md#flow-a--auditoraudit-cycle-automated).

### `/auditor:audit-assist`
**Arg:** `[path] [--scope full|program|backend|frontend]`
**Flow B — human-in-the-loop.** Same lifecycle as `audit-cycle`, but pauses at checkpoints (after scope, context, each review phase, triage, reconciliation) to surface (a) confirmed findings, (b) next-focus plan, (c) the targeted questions only a human can answer, then folds answers back in.
**When:** business-logic / trust-model judgment matters. **Emits:** the same client-facing report, converged iteratively. Detail: [audit-flows.md](audit-flows.md#flow-b--auditoraudit-assist-interactive).

---

## Validation

### `/auditor:triage`
**Arg:** `[audit_<n>] [--program-id <id>]`
One consolidated, re-runnable triage checkpoint over the candidate finding set (so calibration is auditable in one place, not diffused across leaf reviewers). De-dups by **root-cause signature** (with `audit-mem check` auto-suppressing prior-ruled false positives and `audit-mem regressions` flagging FIXED→re-observed, when the tools are built), re-applies **Rule 5b** in batch (every N≥6 carries its validation block or is downgraded to `[UNCONFIRMED]`/`[UNDETERMINED]`, every downgrade **quantified**), and splits real findings (severity 1-10) from the **Notes & Nitpicks** list.
**When:** between the review phase and reconciliation; re-run after any new candidates. **Emits:** the triaged set + a **suppression appendix** recording what was withheld and why (idempotent — re-running folds in new candidates without re-litigating settled ones).

### `/auditor:economic-sim`
**Arg:** `<finding-or-instruction>`
Quantifies a candidate economic finding: model capital/setup cost, extractable value, atomicity, flash-loanable ceilings per venue; compute whether profit > cost at 1/5/10% manipulation; if a Surfpool mainnet-fork is available, reproduce deposit→manipulate→withdraw against forked state for a real net P/L.
**When:** a High/Critical economic finding needs the dollar figure Rule 5b requires. **Emits:** the quantified PoC (dollar figures, not yes/no). See [power-tools.md](power-tools.md#surfpool-economic-simulation).

### `/auditor:poc`
**Arg:** `<finding-id | INC-n.k | file:line> [--fork] [--fuzz] [--force]`
Turns a *confirmed* finding into a runnable exploit: resolve the finding + its context worksheet, gate on severity (N≥7 by default; `--force` overrides), detect the toolchain (never assume), pick the harness by finding type (Mollusk / LiteSVM / Surfpool `--fork` / Trident-cargo-fuzz `--fuzz`), spawn `poc-engineer` to fill a feature-gated `vulnerable`/`fixed` crate that **asserts** the flaw.
**When:** demonstrate a High/Critical finding executably. **Emits:** `audit_<n>/poc/F-xxx/` (crate + one-command `run.sh`) + the earned `[PoC-*]` tier. Never hard-fails — toolchain absence → `[PoC-ATTEMPTED]` + the prose PoC is kept. Full detail: [poc-and-patches.md](poc-and-patches.md).

### `/auditor:patch`
**Arg:** `<finding-id | INC-n.k> [--verify-with-mutation]`
Drafts and verifies a fix: `patch-engineer` writes a **minimal idiomatic** unified diff against the pinned commit that closes *exactly* the cited bound (obeys the Rust/Anchor/Pinocchio rules), applies it to a **scratch worktree** (never the client tree), rebuilds, and **re-runs the finding's PoC** — which must now revert. `--verify-with-mutation` adds `mewt` mutation + a blast-radius check.
**When:** hand the client a proven fix. **Emits:** `audit_<n>/patches/F-xxx.patch` + `VERIFICATION.md` + the `[FIX-*]` tier. Proposal only — `[FIX-VERIFIED]` requires an *executed* revert; no PoC → `[FIX-PROPOSED]` ceiling. Detail: [poc-and-patches.md](poc-and-patches.md).

---

## Reporting

### `/auditor:audit-report`
**Arg:** `[audit-dir]`
Aggregates the session's checkpoints and findings into the final report: de-dup + classify by severity, assemble from `templates/report-template.md` (executive summary with safe-to-deploy verdict, Scope Coverage table, per-checklist verdicts, findings, Phase 4.5 maturity scorecard, remediation roadmap CRITICAL→INFO).
**When:** you ran the walk in pieces and need the report assembled. **Emits:** `audit_<n>/REPORT.md`; flags any in-scope item lacking a verdict as `[INCOMPLETE — in-scope item without verdict]`. (Driven by the `audit-reporter` agent, which does assembly only — no code re-analysis.)

---

## Fix-review

### `/auditor:re-audit`
**Arg:** `[prior-report] [base..head]`
Fix-review / re-audit against a prior `audit_<n>/REPORT.md` (arg 1) and the current tree (delta `base..head`, default `main..HEAD`). Classifies every prior finding **FIXED / PARTIALLY-FIXED / STILL-OPEN / REGRESSED / ACKNOWLEDGED / DISPUTED** — each non-open status citing the **remediation commit/PR hash**, and re-running Rule 5b on the fix (a cosmetic/incomplete patch is not FIXED). Then audits the changed surface for NEW findings (diff-audit path) and runs a **sibling-patch-propagation sweep** for un-patched twins of every fixed anti-pattern (the sweep always emits a result — "no siblings found" is a first-class output). Its diff-audit pass includes the dependency lane, and differential execution (step 4b) runs in the intake execution mode (Rule 11a).
**When:** the team responded to findings and you verify. **Emits:** `audit_<n+1>/RE-AUDIT.md` — finding-diff table + new findings + sibling sweep + updated deploy verdict.
Verification-verb discipline: use "we re-tested and confirmed" only when *you* verified against the current tree; a client's "we fixed it" stays "client states fixed (unverified)" and is not FIXED until independently confirmed.

---

## Detection & response

Post-incident only — never part of an audit. Both commands are propose-only: they never sign, send, simulate against a public cluster, pause or freeze anything. Contract: [`references/detection-response/README.md`](../references/detection-response/README.md); orientation: [detection-response.md](detection-response.md).

### `/auditor:hunt`
**Arg:** `[<address> ...] [--logs <dir>] [--repo <path>] [--window <fromUnix>..<toUnix>] [--collect] [--fresh]`
Threat hunt with **no alert to start from**: snapshots the deployed programs first, then baselines a Solana transaction corpus (your own `--logs` export first; otherwise a gated, capped RPC collection that runs only after you confirm the addresses, window and call budget — `--collect` in non-interactive runs), records each hypothesis and its query in a ledger, checks each suspect against the source deployed at the incident slot via `context-builder`, and reproduces it on the program's real bytes via `poc-engineer`. Driven by the `incident-responder` agent.
**When:** you suspect an attack but have no specific lead. **Emits:** `incident_<n>/LEDGER.md`, `INCIDENTS.json`, `INCIDENT_REPORT.md` and the program snapshot under `bin/` (the run directory's first file is a `.gitignore` of `*`). Verdicts follow the [one normative ladder](../references/detection-response/README.md#the-verdict-ladder-the-one-normative-copy).

### `/auditor:respond`
**Arg:** `<INC-n.k | signature | address | 'alert json' | 'free text'> [--logs <dir>] [--repo <path>] [--collect] [--fresh]`
Takes **one lead** — a transaction signature, an address, an alert, an indicator of compromise, or an `INC-<n>.<k>` from a hunt — and widens it by one ring of related accounts and signers; it then settles whether the attack landed, sizes the damage per mint, pins the root cause in the deployed source, reproduces it locally on the real bytes, and drafts containment, remediation and recovery steps for people to carry out.
**When:** an alert fired or funds are known to be gone — after the pause/freeze runbook and a SEAL 911 ticket, never instead of them. **Emits:** the enriched `incident_<n>/INCIDENTS.json` and `RESPONSE-INC-<n>.<k>.md` — a **proposed** plan that people approve and carry out; the command performs none of it.
