# Pre-Audit Questionnaire

> These questions must be answered before running a full audit.
> The auditor agent uses these answers to contextualize findings, skip N/A sections, and calibrate severity.
> Most are multiple-choice or yes/no. Some require short text answers.
>
> **For automated pipelines:** parse this as YAML or collect via form UI.
> **For manual use:** copy this file, fill in your answers, and include it when invoking the audit.

## How Answers Affect the Audit

| Answer | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Q1 = DeFi | Enables economic attack scenarios (checklists 06, known vectors 1-30) |
| Q2 = Solana | Enables Solana-specific checklists (01-07) |
| Q8 = Mainnet live | Increases all severity scores by 1 for fund-related findings |
| Q10 > $1M | Doubles the weight of critical findings in risk score |
| Q11 = Single wallet | Auto-flags as Severity 8+ finding |
| Q17 = Yes | Requires full economic review (checklist 06) |
| Q25 = First audit | Triggers more thorough analysis, no assumptions about prior fixes |
| Q32 = No tests | Auto-flags testing gaps, enables checklist 16 recommendations |
| Q35 = MiCA/GDPR | Enables compliance checklist (18) |
| Q39 = Specific scope | Skips irrelevant checklists, reduces cost/time |
| Q41 = Quick scan | Uses grep + known vectors only, skips semantic analysis |
