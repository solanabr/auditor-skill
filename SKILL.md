## SCOPE-GATED LOADING — Load What The Repo Needs

auditor-skill does not read its whole corpus up front. It discovers the repo, declares a scope, loads only what that scope requires, then guarantees a verdict for every in-scope item.

**Step 1 — Discover (cheap, always).** Enumerate file extensions and markers (`Anchor.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, `package.json`, `*.py`, `.github/`). No checklists or vectors loaded yet.

**Step 2 — Declare scope.** Map detected languages (+ any `--scope`) to the in-scope checklist set:

| Detected | Load checklists |
|----------|-----------------|
| `.rs` / `Anchor.toml` | 01–07 (+ 20 for `.rs` outside `programs/`) |
| `.ts` / `.tsx` | 08 (+ 09 if backend, + 10 if web) |
| `.py` | 14 |
| `.go` / `.java` / `.rb` / `.php` / other | 15 |
| AI / agent components (`.mcp.json`, agent SDKs) | 19 |
| **any repo** | 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18 |

Checklists outside this set are **never read** — a Rust-only repo never loads 14 or the TS/web vectors.

**Step 3 — Load on demand.** Load an in-scope checklist when its phase begins; load a known-vector only when its phase + language/domain trigger reaches it (`known-vectors/INDEX.md` groups vectors by `{phase, language, trigger}`). Beyond the phase+language gate, vectors and feature-specific checklist sections also load on **feature presence** via the INDEX **"Load when (markers)"** column and the prescan advisory manifest (`references/orchestration/pre-scan.md`): a vector/section whose feature markers are *provably absent* (empty prescan array or zero grep hits) is skip-deferred and renders `[N/A — feature absent]`. This is advisory only — it reopens on demand the instant a manual read surfaces the feature, and every in-scope item still gets a verdict (Rule 0).

**Completeness is output-side.** The audit is COMPLETE iff every in-scope item + phase-triggered vector has a verdict. Out-of-scope items render `[N/A — out of scope: <reason>]` from the gate. Every full report includes a **Scope Coverage** table. Full rule: see [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) Rule 0.

**Step 4 — Reference layer (progressive disclosure).** Beyond the checklists, load a `references/` file only when its trigger fires — deep coverage at zero cost when irrelevant:

| Reference | Load when (grep markers) |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| `references/framework-idioms/{anchor,native,pinocchio}.md` | that framework is detected |
| `references/framework-idioms/build-and-tooling.md` | build/CI/toolchain errors or PoC-harness setup |

## Severity Scale (1–10)

- **10–9 🔴 CRITICAL** — fund drain / fund loss → **block deploy**
- **8–7 🟠 HIGH** — partial drain, privilege escalation, significant damage → **fix before release**
- **6–5 🟡 MEDIUM** — state corruption, DoS, logic bugs, moderate info leak → **fix soon**
- **4–1 🔵 LOW / ⚪ INFO** — minor leak, missing best practice, hardening, cosmetic → **next sprint / backlog**

Full severity table + decision guide: see [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) Rule 1.

## Core Principles

### 1. Walk The Code — Never One-Shot
Repositories can be 10 files or 10,000 files. The auditor reads files **one at a time**, never guesses, and saves checkpoints between chunks. See [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) Rule 3.

### 2. Every Item Gets a Verdict
All in-scope checklist items (up to 1,346) and all in-scope known vectors (up to 131) appear in the report with explicit verdicts. Nothing is silently skipped. See [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) Rule 4.

### 3. Executive Summary First
Every report starts with a plain-language summary: what was audited, what was found, whether it's safe to deploy. See [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) Rule 2.

### 4. Language Auto-Detection
The auditor scans file extensions and applies the correct checklists automatically. No language left behind. See [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) Rule 7.

### 5. Honesty Over Completeness
If context was lost, a file was too large, or a pattern is unfamiliar — say so. Never mark `[PASS]` without reading the code. See [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) Rule 10.

---

## Audit Modes

- **Mode 1 — FULL Repository Audit.** Complete security review of the entire codebase. → Read [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md), then follow [FULL-AUDIT.md](FULL-AUDIT.md) top to bottom (discovery, per-instruction review, report via [templates/report-template.md](templates/report-template.md)).
- **Mode 2 — Targeted Checklist Audit.** Review a specific domain or subset of files. → Read [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) + the relevant `checklists/` file, walk target files one at a time, record every verdict inline.
- **Mode 3 — Single Instruction / Function Review.** Deep-dive into one handler, endpoint, or function. → Read the source completely, fill [templates/instruction-worksheet.md](templates/instruction-worksheet.md), cross-reference shared-state code.
- **Mode 4 — Differential / PR-Scoped Audit.** A PR, commit range, or branch — not the whole tree. → Command `/auditor:diff-audit` (changed-set → Phase 0.5 on changed fns + 1-hop → risk-classify + git-blame removed guards → in-scope items through Rule 5b → `audit_<n>/PR-REPORT.md`).
- **Mode 5 — Spec-Compliance Audit.** A spec / whitepaper / RFC is supplied and you need code-vs-spec conformance. → Command `/auditor:spec-audit` (Spec-IR requirement list → map each instruction/state field → Compliance Matrix through the Rule 5b gate).

---

## Audit Flows (full engagement lifecycle)

Two flows run the traditional audit-company lifecycle over the skill's **existing** mechanisms (scope-gating → Phase 0.5 context → manual review → Rule 5b verification → Phase 4.5 maturity → report). Method: [references/audit-lifecycle/methodology.md](references/audit-lifecycle/methodology.md); how real firms work: [references/audit-lifecycle/firm-coverage.md](references/audit-lifecycle/firm-coverage.md).

- **`/auditor:audit-cycle`** — *fully automated audit team.* Runs the whole lifecycle autonomously: domain-partitioned `vuln-hunter` + `economic-analyst` (each self-triaging via Rule 5b + `false-positives.md` at the leaf) → independent `peer-reviewer` reconciliation on top-severity findings → `audit-reporter` synthesis → a client-facing report ([templates/audit-report.md](templates/audit-report.md)) at `audit_<n>/REPORT.md` (+ optional PDF via `scripts/report-to-pdf.sh`, pandoc-gated — MD is always the deliverable).
- **`/auditor:audit-assist`** — *AI-assisted, human-in-the-loop.* Same lifecycle, pausing at checkpoints to surface confirmed findings + next-focus + the questions only a human can answer (business context, trust model, severity calls); iterates until the audit document converges.
- **`/auditor:re-audit`** — *fix-review.* Diffs against a prior report: per-finding `FIXED` / `STILL-OPEN` / `REGRESSED`, plus a sibling-patch-propagation sweep (grep the codebase for the same anti-pattern the fix closed).

Honestly scoped: this is audit-shaped automation / a rigorous first pass, not a substitute for a human firm audit. The client report follows firm convention — maturity narrative + trust-model caveats + disclaimer — and does **not** issue a "safe to deploy" guarantee. *(Precedents: Neodyme independent dual-review, Trail of Bits weekly progress reports + code-maturity, Sec3 shift-left, Zellic importance-ordering, Zenith delta review.)*

---

## Rationalizations to Reject

An auditor talks itself out of real findings with lines like these. Treat each as a RED FLAG that demands the Rule 5b gate — not a reason to skip:

- "It's only devnet / a test program." → Audit as if mainnet; devnet code ships.
- "The math can't overflow because values are always small." → Prove the bound (Rule 5b Math/State-Bounds) or report it.
- "`init_if_needed` is fine here." → It permits reinitialization; prove the guard or flag it.
- "Only the admin can call this." → Confirm the signer/authority check exists in code; "should be" is not "is".
- "The client validates it." → On-chain must not trust off-chain validation.
- "This `unwrap()` can't fail." → On user/RPC input it can — that is a DoS (checklist 20).
- "It's the same as a well-known program." → Verify line-by-line; forks drift.

*(Scaffolding pattern credit: Trail of Bits `skill-improver`.)*

## When NOT to Use

- Writing new features or general (non-security) code — this skill only audits.
- As the sole gate for a mainnet launch — it is a thorough first pass; pair it with a human audit for business-logic, economic-model, and legal-compliance review.
- As formal proof of correctness — it flags where proofs/harnesses are missing (and can orchestrate them via `vendor/trailofbits`), but does not itself constitute a machine-checked proof.

## Language → Checklist Mapping

Authoritative mapping → **Scope-Gated Loading, Step 2** (scope table) above. Detected extension/marker → in-scope checklist set; always-applied (any repo): 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18.
