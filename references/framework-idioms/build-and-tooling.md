# Framework Idioms — Build & Tooling (Dev-Time Reference Catalog)

> **Load when:** build / CI / tooling errors, or environment setup — a repo won't compile,
> `anchor build` / `cargo build-sbf` fails, a test runner won't start, or a toolchain
> version mismatch is blocking the audit.
>
> **Purpose:** This is a *dev-time* reference, not a per-audit checklist. Build failures are
> almost never the vulnerability — but an auditor who can't build the target can't run tests,
> reproduce a PoC, or trust the artifact under review. This catalog keeps parity with
> `safe-solana-builder` §8/§10 so the fix is one lookup away, without paying its token cost on
> every audit. Nothing here gets a PASS/FAIL verdict; it is troubleshooting, not scoring.
>
> **Scope:** Anchor 0.29 → 1.x, native `cargo build-sbf`, Pinocchio, and the SVM test runners
> (LiteSVM / solana-bankrun / Mollusk). Read alongside `.claude/rules/{anchor,rust,pinocchio}.md`.
>
> *(Adapted from safe-solana-builder `references/{anchor,native-rust,pinocchio}.md` §8 / §10.)*

## When this matters to an audit (and when it doesn't)

- **Matters:** you need a verifiable build to diff against the deployed program hash; you need
  the test suite to run to confirm a fuzz/PoC harness; a `Cargo.lock` mismatch means the code
  you read is not the code that ships.
- **Does not matter:** a cosmetic CLI/crate version warning that still produces a correct
  artifact is not a finding. Do not report build noise as a security issue.

---

## 1. Anchor — build & tooling

### 1.1 GLIBC too old (`GLIBC_2.38` / `GLIBC_2.39` not found)

Anchor CLI links against the host glibc. **Anchor 0.31+ requires GLIBC ≥ 2.38; Anchor 0.32+
requires ≥ 2.39.** Ubuntu 24.04+ ships 2.39; Debian 12 / Ubuntu 22.04 ship 2.36/2.35 and fail.

**Fix:** upgrade the OS, or build the CLI from source against the local toolchain:
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/solana-foundation/anchor --tag v0.31.1 anchor-cli
```

### 1.2 `proc_macro_span_shrink` / Rust ≥ 1.80 incompatibility

Anchor **0.30.x** pulls a `time` crate version that does not compile on rustc ≥ 1.80.

**Fix:** use AVM (it auto-pins rustc 1.79 for Anchor < 0.31), or upgrade to Anchor 0.31+.

### 1.3 `unexpected_cfg` warnings

Newer rustc is stricter about unknown `cfg` conditions (Anchor's `idl-build` emits some).
Silence, or upgrade to 0.31+:
```toml
[lints.rust]
unexpected_cfgs = { level = "allow" }
```

### 1.4 IDL build fails (`anchor build` / `anchor idl build`)

The `idl-build` feature has been required since **0.30.0**. Missing it is the usual cause.
```toml
[features]
idl-build = ["anchor-lang/idl-build", "anchor-spl/idl-build"]
```
Debug with `ANCHOR_LOG=1 anchor build`. Skip IDL emission with `anchor build --no-idl`.

### 1.5 `module inner is private`

Version skew between the `anchor-lang` crate and the Anchor CLI. Match the versions declared
in `Cargo.toml` and `Anchor.toml`.

### 1.6 `overflow-checks` not set (Anchor 0.30+)

**Audit-relevant:** without this, release builds wrap silently and arithmetic checks in the
source do nothing at runtime. Confirm it is present:
```toml
[profile.release]
overflow-checks = true
```

### 1.7 Version migration quick reference

- **0.29 → 0.30:** change `.accounts({...})` → `.accountsPartial({...})`; add the `idl-build`
  feature (§1.4).
- **0.30 → 0.31:** drop direct `solana-program` / `solana-sdk` deps; use
  `anchor_lang::prelude::*` instead.
- **0.31 → 0.32:** `solana-program` fully removed — use `solana_pubkey::Pubkey` or the
  prelude. **Duplicate mutable accounts now error by default** — resolve with the `dup`
  constraint (note this is also a security-relevant default; see `anchor.md` §5).

### 1.8 `Connection refused` / IPv6 in tests (test hangs)

Node.js 17+ resolves `localhost` to `::1`, but `solana-test-validator` binds `127.0.0.1`.
The test client connects to nothing and hangs.

**Fix:** set `cluster = "http://127.0.0.1:8899"` in `Anchor.toml`, or run with
`NODE_OPTIONS="--dns-result-order=ipv4first"`.

### 1.9 `declare_program!` IDL not found

`declare_program!` resolves the IDL from disk at compile time. Place the JSON at
`idls/<program_name>.json` in the workspace root, with a **snake_case** filename that matches
the program name exactly.

### 1.10 CLI / crate version-mismatch warnings

Warnings like `anchor-lang version(0.32.1) and CLI(0.30.1) don't match` are **cosmetic** —
builds succeed. Align `Anchor.toml [toolchain]` and `avm install <version>` to clear them.
Do not treat as a finding.

---

## 2. Native Rust — build & tooling

### 2.1 `cargo build-sbf` not found

The Solana CLI is not installed or not on `PATH`. Note: **`build-sbf`, not `build-bpf`** —
BPF is deprecated (§2.2).
```
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

### 2.2 `cargo build-bpf` deprecation warning

Expected. BPF is superseded by SBF — use `cargo build-sbf`. Anchor 0.30+ invokes the right one
automatically.

### 2.3 Platform-tools corruption after install

```
[ERROR] The Solana toolchain is corrupted. Run cargo-build-sbf with --force-tools-install
```
Root cause is almost always **insufficient disk during extraction** (~2 GB needed).

**Fix:** `cargo build-sbf --force-tools-install`. If the root partition is small, symlink
`~/.cache/solana/` to a larger disk.

### 2.4 `feature edition2024 is required` (Cargo 1.84 / platform-tools v1.48)

Platform-tools v1.48 bundles `cargo 1.84.0`, which does **not** support `edition = "2024"`.
A transitive dep bumping to edition 2024 breaks the build. Pin the known offenders:
```bash
cargo generate-lockfile
cargo update -p blake3           --precise 1.8.2
cargo update -p constant_time_eq --precise 0.3.1
cargo update -p base64ct         --precise 1.7.3
cargo update -p indexmap         --precise 2.11.4
```
**Commit `Cargo.lock`.** This is the single most effective prevention — and it is
audit-relevant: an uncommitted lockfile means the reviewed source and the built artifact can
diverge.

### 2.5 `No space left on device`

The CLI + platform tools want 2–5 GB. Prune old releases:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.local/share/solana/install/releases/<old_version>/
rm -rf ~/.cache/solana/
```

### 2.6 `agave-install not found`

Anchor 0.31+ / Solana ≥ 1.18.19 migrated to `agave-install`.

**Fix:** `sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"`.

### 2.7 `solana-test-validator` crashes or hangs

```bash
pkill -f solana-test-validator && rm -rf test-ledger/
```
Check for a port clash: `lsof -i :8899`. Consider **Surfpool** as a modern
mainnet-fork alternative for reproducing on-chain state.

---

## 3. SVM test runners — the GLIBC fork in the road

The most common reason an otherwise-buildable repo's **tests** won't run on an older host.

### 3.1 LiteSVM `undefined symbol: __isoc23_strtol` — GLIBC < 2.38

The LiteSVM 0.5.0 npm native binary is linked against **GLIBC ≥ 2.38**. On Debian 12 /
Ubuntu 22.04 (GLIBC 2.36/2.35) it fails to load with `__isoc23_strtol`.

**Fallback (verified on GLIBC 2.36):** switch to **`solana-bankrun`** (or **Mollusk** for
Rust-side tests), which do not have the 2.38 floor:
```bash
pnpm remove litesvm anchor-litesvm
pnpm add -D solana-bankrun anchor-bankrun
```
Mollusk (Rust) is the alternative when the harness lives in-crate rather than in TS. This
matters to an audit because the Rule 5b PoC for an arithmetic/economic finding often needs a
working SVM harness — if LiteSVM won't load, the fallback is how you still produce the PoC.

---

## 4. Pinocchio — build & tooling

Pinocchio uses the **same `cargo build-sbf` toolchain as native Rust** — everything in §2 and
§3 applies (platform-tools corruption, `edition2024` pins + commit `Cargo.lock`, LiteSVM
GLIBC fallback, `build-sbf not found`). Pinocchio-specific additions:

### 4.1 `wincode` proc-macro not found

The `SchemaWrite` / `SchemaRead` derives are **feature-gated**. Enable them:
```toml
[dependencies]
wincode = { version = "0.4", features = ["derive"] }
```

### 4.2 `wincode` / `bytemuck` zero-copy fails to compile — implicit padding

A `#[repr(C)]` struct with implicit padding is **not** eligible for zero-copy
(de)serialization and the compiler rejects it. Reorder fields largest-alignment-first, or add
an explicit `_padding: [u8; N]` until it compiles. (Audit note: the same padding that unblocks
the build must be **zeroed on construction** — stale padding bytes can leak across
instructions; that part *is* a check, tracked in `pinocchio.md`.)

### 4.3 IDL generation (Shank)

Pinocchio does not auto-emit an IDL. Generate with Shank, then pipe to Codama for clients:
```
shank idl -o idl.json -p src/lib.rs
```

## Build & tooling fast pass (for the auditor)

Not a scored checklist — a triage sequence when the target won't build/test:

- [ ] Framework + version identified (Anchor `Anchor.toml` / native / Pinocchio) → apply the right §
- [ ] Host GLIBC vs. tool floor checked (Anchor CLI ≥2.38/2.39; LiteSVM ≥2.38) (§1.1, §3.1)
- [ ] `Cargo.lock` present and committed; `edition2024` pins applied if platform-tools v1.48 (§2.4)
- [ ] Disk headroom ≥ 2 GB for platform-tools; `--force-tools-install` if corrupted (§2.3)
- [ ] **`overflow-checks = true`** in `[profile.release]` — else runtime arithmetic checks are inert (§1.6) — *this one is audit-relevant, flag it if absent*
- [ ] Test runner loads (LiteSVM → bankrun/Mollusk fallback on old GLIBC) so a PoC harness can run (§3.1)
- [ ] Version/CLI-mismatch **warnings** that still build correctly are noted, not reported as findings (§1.10)
