# Framework Idioms — Native Rust (Audit Checks)

> **Purpose:** What to verify and what fails when auditing a native (no-framework) Solana
> program built directly on `solana-program` / `pinocchio`-free Rust.
> **Scope:** Native `process_instruction` programs. Read alongside `.claude/rules/rust.md`.
> **Core premise:** In native Rust there is **no framework to catch you**. Every check Anchor
> does automatically is manual — miss one and it ships as a vulnerability. The auditor's job
> is to confirm each manual check exists **and runs in the correct order**.

## 1. The mandatory validation ORDER

For **every** account an instruction touches, these checks must run — in this order —
*before any field of that account's data is read or trusted*:

```
1. Key check        — is this the exact account I expect (fixed accounts: sysvars, config, known programs)?
2. Owner check      — does the correct program own this account?
3. Signer check     — did this account sign, where a signature is required?
4. Writable check   — is this account writable, where mutation is required?
5. Discriminator    — does the data actually belong to the expected type?
6. Data/field range — after deserialize, are the fields within valid ranges?
```

**Why the order matters (not just the presence):**
- **Owner before deserialize** is the single most-missed check. Deserializing bytes from an
  account owned by another program is a **type-cosplay** attack — the layout may match by
  accident and every field is attacker-controlled.
- **Discriminator before field use** stops a same-shape account of a *different type* (both
  owned by your program) from being substituted.
- Reading a field (step 6) before steps 2/5 have run means the field value is meaningless.

**Auditor check**
- ✅ PASS: each account's checks appear in this sequence, and no `try_from_slice` /
  field access precedes the owner + discriminator checks for that account.
- ❌ FAIL: any account deserialized before its owner check; discriminator skipped; signer
  assumed from account position; a fixed account (sysvar/known program) identified by index
  alone rather than a hardcoded key comparison.

```
# owner checks present?
grep -rn -E "\.owner *(==|!=)|owner != program_id|is_owned_by" programs/
# signer / writable checks present?
grep -rn -E "is_signer|is_writable" programs/
# deserialization sites — each must be preceded by owner+discriminator+length checks
grep -rn -E "try_from_slice|from_bytes|from_account" programs/
# fixed-account key checks (sysvars/programs) — must compare against a hardcoded ID
grep -rn -E "sysvar::|::ID|find_program_address|create_program_address" programs/
```

---

## 2. `TryFrom<&[AccountInfo]>` — the accounts-validation idiom

The clean way to guarantee the order above is a `TryFrom` that parses the account slice into
a named struct and performs **all** structural checks up front. Business logic then runs on
already-validated accounts.

```rust
pub struct WithdrawAccounts<'a> {
    pub authority: &'a AccountInfo<'a>,
    pub vault:     &'a AccountInfo<'a>,
    pub system_program: &'a AccountInfo<'a>,
}

impl<'a> TryFrom<&'a [AccountInfo<'a>]> for WithdrawAccounts<'a> {
    type Error = ProgramError;
    fn try_from(accounts: &'a [AccountInfo<'a>]) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        let [authority, vault, system_program, ..] = accounts else {
            return Err(ProgramError::NotEnoughAccountKeys);   // 0. arity FIRST
        };
        if !authority.is_signer      { return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature); }
        if vault.owner != &crate::ID { return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId); }     // owner before data
        if !vault.is_writable        { return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData); }
        if system_program.key != &solana_program::system_program::ID {
            return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);     // fixed account by KEY, not index
        }
        Ok(Self { authority, vault, system_program })
    }
}
```

**Auditor check**
- ✅ PASS: account arity checked first (slice-pattern or explicit length), then owner →
  signer → writable → fixed-key checks, before the handler reads any data. Discriminator +
  field ranges checked at the point of deserialization.
- ❌ FAIL: ad-hoc `accounts[3]` indexing scattered through the handler with no central
  validation; arity not checked (panics on a short account list); checks interleaved with
  business logic such that some data is read before its account is validated.

```
grep -rn -E "TryFrom<.*AccountInfo|impl.*TryFrom" programs/
grep -rn -E "accounts\[[0-9]+\]|iter\(\)\.next\(\)" programs/   # raw indexing → is arity + per-account validation present?
```

## 3. Manual borrow lifecycle — drop before re-borrow

`AccountInfo` data is a `RefCell`. Holding an immutable borrow (`try_borrow_data`) and a
mutable borrow (`try_borrow_mut_data`) of the **same** account at once **panics at runtime**
(`already borrowed`). The same applies to lamports borrows.

**Auditor check**
- ✅ PASS: each borrow is scoped and dropped (`drop(data)` or an inner `{ }` block) before a
  new borrow of the same account is taken. Deserialize-into-owned-value, drop the borrow,
  then re-borrow mutably to write back.
- ❌ FAIL: a mutable and immutable borrow of the same account live simultaneously; a borrow
  held across a CPI or across a call that re-borrows the same account; a long-lived borrow
  that outlives its need and blocks a later write.

```
grep -rn -E "try_borrow_data|try_borrow_mut_data|try_borrow_lamports|try_borrow_mut_lamports" programs/
# inspect each site: is the earlier borrow dropped/scoped before the next borrow of the SAME account?
```

---

## 4. Post-CPI manual re-deserialize

Native Rust has **no `.reload()`**. After a CPI mutates an account, any value you
deserialized *before* the CPI is stale. To use the account's state after the CPI you must
**re-borrow and re-deserialize** from the account's current bytes.

**Auditor check**
- ✅ PASS: after every CPI that can change an account, the handler re-borrows and
  re-`try_from_slice`s that account before making any decision on its state. A pre-CPI local
  is never reused post-CPI for a balance/authority/state check.
- ❌ FAIL: a struct deserialized before `invoke`/`invoke_signed` is read after it — e.g. an
  accounting check that uses the pre-transfer balance and therefore always passes.

```
grep -rn -E "invoke\(|invoke_signed\(" programs/
# for each: is there a re-borrow + re-deserialize of the mutated account AFTER the invoke,
# before its state is used again?
grep -rn -E "try_from_slice|from_bytes" programs/
```

---

## 5. Supporting manual guarantees (confirm each)

These are the other checks Anchor gives for free that a native program must implement:

- **Data length before deserialize** — `if account.data_len() < T::LEN { return Err(...) }`.
  An undersized account panics or misreads during deserialization.
- **Canonical bump stored at init, reused via `create_program_address`** on later calls
  (never `find_program_address` on the hot path, never a user-supplied bump).
- **Checked arithmetic** on all value math (`checked_add`/`sub`/`mul`, division-by-zero
  guard) — native has no `overflow-checks` safety net at runtime in release unless set.
- **No `unwrap()` / `expect()` / `panic!`** in handlers — they abort the program.
- **Secure close sequence** — zero data (`realloc(0, false)`), drain lamports to a **trusted**
  recipient, reassign owner to System Program. Skipping realloc/reassign enables
  revival/re-init.
- **Duplicate mutable account check** — two writable accounts that may alias the same key
  must be rejected (Anchor 0.31+ does this automatically; native must do it by hand).

```
grep -rn -E "data_len\(\) *<|\.len\(\) *<" programs/          # length guards before deserialize
grep -rn -E "find_program_address|create_program_address" programs/
grep -rn -E "checked_add|checked_sub|checked_mul|checked_div|\+|\-|\*" programs/  # any raw arithmetic on value math?
grep -rn -E "unwrap\(\)|expect\(|panic!" programs/*/src
grep -rn -E "realloc\(0|assign\(" programs/                   # close sequence completeness
```

## Native Rust idiom checklist (fast pass)

- [ ] Validation order key → owner → signer → writable → discriminator → field-range, per account (§1)
- [ ] Owner check precedes every `try_from_slice`; no data trusted before it (§1)
- [ ] Accounts validated centrally via `TryFrom<&[AccountInfo]>`; arity checked first (§2)
- [ ] Fixed accounts (sysvars/known programs) identified by hardcoded key, not index (§1–§2)
- [ ] Borrows scoped/dropped before re-borrow of the same account; no simultaneous mut+immut borrow (§3)
- [ ] After every mutating CPI, account is re-borrowed + re-deserialized before its state is reused (§4)
- [ ] Data-length guard before deserialize; canonical bump stored + reused; checked arithmetic; no `unwrap()`; safe close sequence; duplicate-mut-account check (§5)
