# Framework Idioms — Pinocchio / Zero-Copy (Audit Checks)

> **Purpose:** What to verify and what fails when auditing a Pinocchio (zero-dependency,
> zero-copy) Solana program.
> **Scope:** Pinocchio + `bytemuck`/`wincode` programs. Read alongside `.claude/rules/pinocchio.md`.
> **Core premise:** Pinocchio buys 80–95% CU reduction by **removing abstractions** — every
> guarantee Anchor gives for free (owner, discriminator, signer, mut, bounds, alignment)
> becomes a manual check, and zero-copy adds a *memory-safety* obligation on top. The
> framework itself is largely unaudited; assume nothing is checked for you.

## 1. Zero-copy layout — `#[repr(C)]` + explicit `_padding` (unaligned = UB)

`bytemuck::from_bytes` casts a `&[u8]` **directly** into `&T`. This is only sound if the
struct has a fully-defined, padding-free C layout. Two things must hold:

1. **`#[repr(C)]`** — Rust's default `repr(Rust)` gives no layout guarantee; a cast is UB.
2. **No implicit padding** — the struct must be padded to its natural alignment (typically
   8 bytes for anything containing a `u64`/`i64`) with an **explicit `_padding` field**, and
   fields ordered largest-first. Implicit padding bytes are uninitialized; casting over them,
   or hashing/serializing them, is undefined behaviour and can **leak stale memory** across
   instructions.

```rust
#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Clone, Copy, Pod, Zeroable)]
pub struct Vault {
    pub owner:        [u8; 32],   // 32
    pub balance:      u64,        // 8
    pub discriminator: u8,        // 1
    pub bump:         u8,         // 1
    pub _padding:     [u8; 6],    // 6  → total 48, 8-byte aligned, NO implicit padding
}
```

**Auditor check**
- ✅ PASS: every zero-copy account/instruction struct is `#[repr(C)]`, fields are ordered to
  avoid implicit padding, and any gap is filled by a named `_padding` field that is
  **zeroed on construction**. `LEN == size_of::<T>()` and equals the on-chain account size.
- ❌ FAIL: a `bytemuck`/zero-copy struct without `#[repr(C)]`; implicit padding (compiler
  would insert gap bytes — often visible as fields ordered small-before-large with no
  `_padding`); `_padding` present but never zeroed (stale-byte leak); a cast onto a
  `#[repr(C, packed)]` struct then taking a reference to a field (unaligned reference → UB).

```
grep -rn -E "repr\(C\)|repr\(C, *packed\)|Pod|Zeroable|from_bytes|from_bytes_mut" programs/
grep -rn -E "_padding|_pad|_reserved" programs/     # is padding explicit AND zeroed on init?
# For each Pod struct: confirm field order is largest→smallest and total size is alignment-multiple.
```

## 2. Discriminator + length **before** any cast

Pinocchio typically uses a **1-byte** (or no) discriminator, not Anchor's 8 bytes. A cast
must be gated by both a length check and a discriminator check — in that order — or a
too-short or wrong-type account produces an OOB read / type cosplay.

```rust
pub fn from_account(account: &AccountInfo) -> Result<&Self, ProgramError> {
    let data = account.try_borrow_data()?;
    if data.len() < Self::LEN            { return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData); } // length first
    if data[0] != VAULT_DISCRIMINATOR    { return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData); } // then type tag
    Ok(bytemuck::from_bytes(&data[..Self::LEN]))
}
```

Because the discriminator is only one byte, it is **not sufficient alone** to identify a
type — it must be combined with the **owner check** (§3) and the length check. A single tag
byte with the right value on an account owned by another program is still a cosplay.

**Auditor check**
- ✅ PASS: every zero-copy read checks `data.len() >= LEN` then the discriminator, and the
  account's owner is verified separately; type is disambiguated by owner + length + tag.
- ❌ FAIL: `from_bytes` on an unchecked-length slice; discriminator skipped; a fixed-index
  slice read (`data[64..72]`) with no preceding length guard; type inferred from one byte
  with no owner/length backing.

```
grep -rn -E "from_bytes|from_bytes_mut|as_ptr|\.add\(|get_unchecked|from_raw_parts" programs/
grep -rn -E "data\[[0-9]+\.\.|\[\.\.[A-Za-z_]+::LEN\]" programs/   # slice reads → is len checked first?
```

## 3. `TryFrom` accounts validation — same mandatory order as native

The recommended Pinocchio idiom is the same `TryFrom<&[AccountInfo]>` pattern used in native
Rust: parse the account slice once, run **all** structural checks up front, then run business
logic on validated accounts. The **order is identical** to
`references/framework-idioms/native.md §1`:

```
key (fixed accounts) → owner → signer → writable → discriminator → field-range
```

```rust
impl<'a> TryFrom<&'a [AccountInfo]> for DepositAccounts<'a> {
    type Error = ProgramError;
    fn try_from(accounts: &'a [AccountInfo]) -> Result<Self, Self::Error> {
        let [vault, owner, system_program, ..] = accounts else {
            return Err(ProgramError::NotEnoughAccountKeys);              // arity first
        };
        if !owner.is_signer()          { return Err(ProgramError::MissingRequiredSignature); }
        if vault.owner() != &crate::ID { return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId); }   // owner before data
        if !vault.is_writable()        { return Err(ProgramError::InvalidAccountData); }
        if system_program.key() != &pinocchio_system::ID {
            return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);
        }
        Ok(Self { vault, owner, system_program })
    }
}
```

**Auditor check**
- ✅ PASS: accounts validated centrally via `TryFrom` (or an equivalent up-front routine);
  arity checked before indexing; owner/signer/writable/fixed-key all present; no field read
  before its account is validated. Post-CPI state is obtained by **re-borrow + re-cast**
  (Pinocchio has no `.reload()`).
- ❌ FAIL: inline ad-hoc checks interleaved with logic; raw indexing without arity check;
  owner or signer assumed; a pre-CPI cast reused after a CPI.

```
grep -rn -E "TryFrom<.*AccountInfo|impl.*TryFrom" programs/
grep -rn -E "is_signer\(\)|is_writable\(\)|\.owner\(\)|\.key\(\)" programs/
grep -rn -E "invoke\(|invoke_signed\(" programs/    # re-borrow + re-cast after each?
```

## 4. Serialization boundary — `bytemuck` vs `wincode` eligibility

Pinocchio programs mix two serializers; each has a distinct correctness envelope.

| Data | Use | Zero-copy eligibility rules |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed-size **account state** | `bytemuck` | `#[repr(C)]`, no implicit padding, explicit zeroed `_padding` (§1) |
| Variable-size **instruction data** | `wincode` (bincode-compatible) | For in-place `ZeroCopy::deserialize`: `#[repr(C)]`, **no implicit padding**, **no tuples** (Rust does not guarantee tuple layout) |
| Borsh-wire-format required | `borsh` | allocates; only when the wire format must be Borsh |

**Auditor check**
- ✅ PASS: account state uses `bytemuck`; instruction data uses `wincode`; the two are not
  mixed in one struct (single ownership boundary). Any `wincode` zero-copy struct is
  `#[repr(C)]`, padding-free (explicit `_padding`), and tuple-free.
- ❌ FAIL: `bytemuck` used on variable-size instruction data (or vice-versa); a `wincode`
  zero-copy struct with implicit padding or a tuple field (won't compile for zero-copy, or
  silently mis-reads if forced); one struct straddling both serializers.

```
grep -rn -E "bytemuck|wincode|borsh|SchemaRead|SchemaWrite|ZeroCopy" programs/
grep -rn -E "\([A-Za-z0-9_]+, *[A-Za-z0-9_]+\)" programs/   # tuple fields in a zero-copy struct?
```

**`wincode` deserialization must be validated (byte layout ≠ business logic):**
- ✅ PASS: `wincode::deserialize(...)` errors are mapped to
  `ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData` (never `unwrap()`); deserialized values are
  range-checked after decode (amounts > 0, deadlines in the future, enum variants valid);
  the default max-size limit for dynamic `Vec` fields is not overridden without a documented
  upper bound (guards against allocation exhaustion).
- ❌ FAIL: `wincode::deserialize(...).unwrap()` in a handler; decoded values used without
  range checks; max-size limit raised with no justification.

```
grep -rn -E "wincode::deserialize|wincode::serialize|ZeroCopy::deserialize" programs/
grep -rn -E "wincode.*unwrap\(\)|deserialize\(.*\)\.unwrap" programs/
```

## 5. Entrypoint choice — per-operation CU vs safety tradeoff

Pinocchio offers several entrypoints trading CU for convenience/safety. The choice is an
audit signal:

| Entrypoint | Trades | Audit implication |
|---|---|---|
| `entrypoint!` | default; auto heap allocator + panic handler | Safe baseline; a `panic!`/`unwrap()` is caught but still aborts |
| `no_allocator!()` + `entrypoint!` | max CU savings; **no heap** — no `String`/`Vec`/`Box` | Any code path that allocates will fail at runtime; confirm none does |
| `lazy_entrypoint!` | defers account parsing until accessed | Accounts are **not** pre-validated by the runtime shape — the program must validate arity/bounds itself before touching accounts, or it panics/OOB |

**Auditor check**
- ✅ PASS: the entrypoint matches the program's needs and its constraints are honored —
  `no_allocator!()` programs contain no allocation; `lazy_entrypoint!` programs perform arity
  + bounds checks before first account access. `overflow-checks = true` is set in
  `[profile.release]` (Pinocchio does not add a runtime overflow net otherwise).
- ❌ FAIL: `no_allocator!()` alongside code that builds a `Vec`/`String`; `lazy_entrypoint!`
  with fixed-index account access and no preceding arity/length validation; missing
  `overflow-checks`.

```
grep -rn -E "entrypoint!|no_allocator!|lazy_entrypoint!|program_entrypoint!" programs/
grep -rn -E "Vec::|String::|Box::|vec!\[" programs/          # allocation under no_allocator!?
grep -rn -E "overflow-checks" programs/*/Cargo.toml Cargo.toml
```

## Pinocchio idiom checklist (fast pass)

- [ ] Every zero-copy struct is `#[repr(C)]`, padding-free, with explicit `_padding` zeroed on construction; no unaligned reference to a `packed` field (§1)
- [ ] Length check then discriminator check before every cast; owner verified separately; type = owner + length + tag (§2)
- [ ] Accounts validated up front via `TryFrom` in key→owner→signer→writable→discriminator→range order; arity before indexing (§3)
- [ ] Post-CPI state via manual re-borrow + re-cast (no `.reload()`) (§3)
- [ ] `bytemuck` for account state, `wincode` for instruction data — not mixed; zero-copy structs are `#[repr(C)]`, padding-free, tuple-free (§4)
- [ ] `wincode` errors → `InvalidInstructionData` (no `unwrap()`); decoded values range-checked; dynamic-size limits not raised without justification (§4)
- [ ] Entrypoint constraints honored (`no_allocator!` → no allocation; `lazy_entrypoint!` → self-validates arity/bounds); `overflow-checks = true` (§5)
