# INCIDENTS.json — the `auditor-incidents/1` shape

*Field vocabulary credited in part to anthropics/defending-code-reference-harness; see ATTRIBUTION.md.*

> **Load when:** writing or reading `incident_<n>/INCIDENTS.json`. The verdict

One file per run directory, written by `/auditor:hunt` and enriched by
`/auditor:respond`. Readers must tolerate unknown extra keys; a breaking change
bumps the `schema` string to `auditor-incidents/2`.

## Field rules

- **`id`** is run-qualified `INC-<n>.<k>` (README). `/auditor:poc` and
  `/auditor:patch` resolve this exact string against this run's file.
- **Where entries go.** Only `confirmed_exploited` and `suspected` belong in
  `incidents[]`; `attempted_not_vulnerable` and `benign` are filed in
  `ruled_out[]`. The one subtlety:
  `suspected` + `outcome: failed` + `poc.verified: true` ("a real flaw was
  attacked and has not landed yet") stays in `incidents[]` — it is a live
  exposure, not a non-event.
- **`vuln`** is a Rule 5b finding with its blocks filled from the *observed*
  incident, so a later `/auditor:threat-model --bootstrap` or audit can ingest it
  as a prior vulnerability. `severity` is the 1–10 finding severity;
  `incident.urgency` is the separate response-speed label and never collides with
  it.
- **`binary_provenance`** records which bytes Leg 3 ran against:
  `dumped-unchanged` (on-chain ELF, last-deployed slot earlier than the incident,
  loader checked), `rebuilt-hash-match` (`solana-verify`, SC-054 / KV-137),
  `dumped-after-hotfix` (a later upgrade overwrote the incident binary — dump and
  hash anyway, provenance noted), `source-only` or `none` (Leg 3 unmet → ceiling
  `suspected`).
- **`poc`** records the run as made. `command` carries `AUDITOR_EXEC_MODE` and
  `VULNERABLE_SO`, plus `FIXED_SO` when a fixed arm ran. `verified` is true only
  when `run.sh` ended with `OK: reproduced on prebuilt bytes — vulnerable
  sha256=<hash>`, `<hash>` being the snapshot's. `negative` is how the fixed arm
  held: `rejected with the pinned error` for our patch, `blocked: failed, account
  unchanged` for a deployed hotfix, or null when no fixed arm ran.
- **`evidence`** strings are `"<source file>: <pipeline> -> <result>"` — the query
  that produced each number (hard rule 5). Never a URL, never a secret.
- **`collection_gaps`** holds every row of the collector's
  `corpus*/collection-gaps.tsv`, as `"<signature or address>: <reason>"` (a fetch
  that failed, history the page cap truncated, the `--max-tx` cap, a stop after
  ten failed fetches in a row), plus the gaps the run found itself (provider
  retention, a `Log truncated` tail, a sibling address not collected). The same
  rows go into LEDGER.md.
- **Secrets / PII.** No RPC URL anywhere, including `collection_gaps`. Victim and
  attacker wallet lists stay in this file inside `incident_<n>/`, which is
  git-ignored; they are not lifted into any shared report.

## The stable read surface for the threat-model bootstrap and audits

A consumer (the threat-model bootstrap, a later audit) reads only: top-level
`schema` and `incidents[]`; per incident `id`, `verdict`, `outcome`,
`root_cause_class`, `vuln.{program,instruction,file,function,line,mechanism,severity,kv,checklist}`,
`poc.tier`, and optionally `urgency`. The threat-model bootstrap reads that surface
except `vuln.severity` and `urgency`, which it leaves out by design. A consumer never reads `attacker`, `transactions`,
`timeline`, `blast_radius`, `evidence`, `binary_provenance`, `collection_gaps` or
`response_plan`, and never the `ruled_out[]` list. These read fields are stable
across runs within `auditor-incidents/1`.
