## What Is This?

auditor-skill is a **skill file** (a structured prompt + checklists) that turns any LLM agent (Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, Codex, etc.) into a professional-grade security auditor. It reads your code file by file, checks 1,459 items across 20 security domains, tests against 140 real-world attack vectors, and produces a structured report with severity scores.

**It is not a SaaS product.** It's a folder of markdown files you install for your AI agent — outside any repository you audit — or send to an LLM API.

> **Adaptation required before use.** This skill was originally developed for a specific Solana/Anchor DeFi project and then generalized. `discovery/file-map.md` assumes that project's layout (`programs/{name}/src/`, `apps/backend/src/`, `apps/web/src/`). If yours differs, record where your code lives at intake instead: the in-scope paths under `QUESTIONS.md` Q39 ("Specific files/modules") and the exclusions under Q44, which `/auditor:intake` writes to the Layout table of `audit_<n>/intake.md` §1. The next interactive intake in the same checkout offers that table again and reuses it only on your yes. An edited `discovery/file-map.md` in a shared or plugin install is lost on the next update. The questionnaire in `QUESTIONS.md` is a blank template — fill it out (or run `/auditor:intake`) for your project before invoking the auditor. Everything else (checklists, known vectors, output rules) is fully portable as-is.

## What It Does (v7.6)

- **Detection & response, post-incident (v7.6).** `/auditor:hunt` works through transaction history, program logs and Geyser/indexer exports with a written hypothesis ledger; `/auditor:respond` starts from a signature, address or alert and establishes whether the attack landed, how far it reached, and why. Verdicts follow a single [ladder](references/detection-response/README.md#the-verdict-ladder-the-one-normative-copy); the response plan is for humans to carry out — the track acts on nothing. Ported Solana-native from Anthropic's defending-code-reference-harness.
- **History-seeded threat models (v7.6).** `/auditor:threat-model --bootstrap` starts the threat model from what already went wrong: removed or quietly added account guards, reverts and fix commits in the target's history, a fork's distance from its parent, prior audit reports, post-mortems and incident records. One read-only, hardened collector (`scripts/threat-model/collect.sh`) gathers it; non-interactive runs stay offline, and every goal cites its evidence.
- **GitHub Actions trigger trust (v7.6).** A CI playbook (`references/vuln-classes/github-actions.md`) for the shapes an outside account uses to reach a privileged job — comment-triggered commands without per-event author gating, expression and env-file injection, `pull_request_target` / `workflow_run` pwn requests with artifact and cache poisoning, and AI coding agents in CI — with KV-139/140, checklist 13 §13.13 (DEP-090..096), AI-034..035, read-only rules of engagement, and zsh-safe locator recipes backed by a fixture self-test.
- **Operating safety & dependency-update review (v7.6).** A new OUTPUT-RULES Rule 11 covers five things. Target code runs in the execution mode chosen at intake (isolated recommended; native allowed, with a report caveat). Outside-service use is disclosed. Untrusted `.git/` checkouts are read without letting git run their config. Audit output never reaches git or a public CI log. Bundled scripts and tools run from the installation, never from a path in the audited repository. Checklist 11 §11.11 (SC-059..062) reviews what a dependency bump's *published code* actually changed, wired into `/auditor:diff-audit` and `/auditor:re-audit`. KV-077 and SC-005 now catch the hijacked `@solana/web3.js` 1.95.6 / 1.95.7 releases.
- **Trail of Bits pin, reviewed and visible (v7.6).** `vendor/trailofbits` moves from `cfe5d7b` (2026-06-30) to `82fe822` (2026-09-28) after a full delta review; upstream had since fixed a semgrep path that silently dropped two third-party rulesets and SARIF parsing that read CodeQL severities as zero errors. The pin is shown under Installation, fetched shallow, checked by CI against the gitlink, and moved by a monthly Dependabot PR that a maintainer reviews with `scripts/tob-delta-review.sh`; plugin users receive it with this release.
- **Slot-as-clock coverage (v7.5).** SIMD-0525 halved mainnet slot time to 200 ms (Oct 9, 2026) and Alpenglow (Oct 21, 2026) made `Clock.unix_timestamp` a leader-set value, so every timelock, vesting cliff, cooldown, oracle window, rate limit and interest constant denominated in slots now elapses in half the wall-clock time. KV-138 covers the class (the EVM learned it at the Merge with Compound's `blocksPerYear`; deployed lending programs still carrying `SLOTS_PER_YEAR = 63,072,000`, whether from an old-SDK build of SPL token-lending, the Save fork's literal or Kamino's legacy basis, now accrue 2.5x the configured APR), with SM-073..074, ECON-090..092, OPS-086..087, BE-132 and FV-073 as the per-domain checks.
- **Vendored-program provenance (v7.4).** Coverage for the newest exploited class on Solana — the Rain white-label card-contract exploit (Aug 2026, ~$1.1M across Avici, Tria and other tenants): KV-137 (deployed-program version drift, fleet blast radius, inherited admin surface), off-chain-signed authority-grant checks (AC-051..055 — the `AddCollateralAdmin` signature-bundle failure) and deployed-program provenance checks (SC-053..058) — the layer `cargo audit` / `npm audit` can't see, because the vulnerable artifact is your own deployed program.
- **Transaction v1 readiness (v7.3).** A vuln-class playbook for SIMD-0385 / SIMD-0296 (4,096-byte transactions, message-level compute config, no ComputeBudget instructions, no lookup tables): who breaks and how, per-role worksheets for RPC readers, indexers / Geyser consumers, fee sponsors / co-signers, introspecting programs, senders and wallets; KV-135 (sponsor cap bypass, disabled ComputeBudget gates) and KV-136 (reader wedge, zero-budget indexing); 23 checklist items across on-chain, TypeScript, backend, frontend, deployment, testing, monitoring and off-chain Rust.
- **Token registries & permissioned tokens (v7.2).** A registry / risk-signal methodology (canonical-asset resolution, primary-variant ranking, score farming — grounded in the open-sourced tokens.xyz stack), Token ACL (SRFC-37) gate-program coverage inside the Token-2022 playbook, and web-stack items for hosted auth, API-key issuance, external data providers, Next.js 16, Bun / Turborepo and GCP / Terraform.
- **A full audit-firm lifecycle, two ways.** `/auditor:audit-cycle` runs the whole engagement autonomously (intake → context → threat model → tool-assisted pass → domain-partitioned review → triage → independent peer review → synthesis) and hands back a professional client report. `/auditor:audit-assist` runs the same pipeline **interactively**, pausing at checkpoints for the calls only you can make.
- **Executable proofs, not just prose.** For High/Critical findings, `/auditor:poc` builds a runnable exploit (Mollusk / LiteSVM / Surfpool-fork / fuzz) that *asserts* the vulnerability, and `/auditor:patch` drafts a minimal fix and **proves it reverts the exploit**. Evidence is tiered (`[PoC-REPRODUCED]` … `[PoC-PROSE]`); prose is never dropped when a harness can't be built.
- **Token-efficient by construction.** An optional Rust pre-scanner (`audit-scan`) enumerates the risky surface deterministically (~$0), cutting ~30-40% of input tokens on large programs. A cross-audit memory store (`audit-mem`) gives exact dedup, regression detection, and false-positive suppression across runs.
- **17 commands, 9 specialized agents.** Scoping, threat modeling, deep review, economic simulation, differential/PR audits, spec compliance, triage, fix-review — each a first-class command, plus a post-incident detection & response track (hunt + respond over transaction history). The automated audit flow chains eight purpose-built agents; a ninth, incident-responder, drives the post-incident track.
- **Deep Solana coverage.** 13 protocol methodologies (AMM/CLMM, lending, perps, oracles, stablecoins, liquid staking, governance, bridges, multisig/custody, Token-2022, NFT marketplaces, launchpads, token registries & risk signals), framework idioms (Anchor/Native/Pinocchio), and a reusable invariant catalog — loaded only when the code triggers them.
- **Rigor gates against AI over-reporting.** A validation gate (reachability + math/state-bounds + attacker-model) every high-severity finding must survive, Impact×Likelihood severity with principled downgrades, and a Notes & Nitpicks tier that keeps the findings table honest.
- **Real tooling, vendored.** Trail of Bits execution plugins (SAST, fuzzing, coverage, mutation) ship as a submodule; the native corpus works fully without them.

## Installation

Install auditor-skill **outside any repository you audit**: the plugin (Option 1), or a user-level skill such as `install.sh ~/.claude/skills/auditor-skill`. A copy inside the audited repository resolves its scripts, tools and corpus from a tree that repository controls, and that repository's own `.claude/`, `.mcp.json` and `CLAUDE.md` are target-controlled too ([OUTPUT-RULES.md Rule 11e](OUTPUT-RULES.md#11e--bundled-paths)).

**Upgrading from 7.6.0 or earlier.** Through 7.6.0, `install.sh` without a path installed into the current directory's `.claude/skills/auditor-skill`; it now installs to `~/.claude/skills/auditor-skill`, and a run started next to such a copy notes it and leaves it alone. If your copy sits inside a repository, delete it (`rm -rf .claude/skills/auditor-skill`) and install a fresh copy outside: the plugin (Option 1), or Option 2. Never move or update a copy you find inside a repository: its git config may have come with that repository. Plugin users get 7.6.1 when they update the plugin.

### Option 1: Claude Code plugin marketplace (recommended)

```
/plugin marketplace add solanabr/auditor-skill
/plugin install auditor
```

Registers the marketplace and installs the `auditor` plugin — all 17 `/auditor:*` commands and 9 agents. Claude Code clones the plugin together with its submodules, so this also fetches the vendored Trail of Bits tooling at the pinned commit (see [Tool execution](#tool-execution-trail-of-bits--optional-rust-tools)); there is no manual step.

### Option 2: Install script

Installs the skill and inits the tooling. With no argument it installs to `~/.claude/skills/auditor-skill`, a user-level skill, wherever you run it from; to install elsewhere, pass a path outside the repositories you audit. It warns on stderr when the install directory is inside a git work tree. Re-running it installs a fresh clone at the same path and moves the earlier install, without running git in it, to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/auditor-skill/backup-<timestamp>`, or `~/.local/state/auditor-skill/backup-<timestamp>` when `XDG_STATE_HOME` is unset or not an absolute path. That private directory must lie outside every skills directory, so that Claude Code does not load the old copy as a second skill: the run refuses a backup directory inside the install's parent directory, or one under a directory named `.claude`, `skills`, `commands` or `agents` in any letter case, on its path as given or with links resolved. The run prints the backup's path. Each upgrade keeps a full copy there, including anything built inside it such as the Rust tools' build output, and nothing removes old backups: delete them when you no longer need them. A symbolic link at the install path or at the backup directory is refused, never followed:

```bash
# read it first (it's a security tool, after all):
git clone https://github.com/solanabr/auditor-skill.git
./auditor-skill/install.sh ~/.claude/skills/auditor-skill    # user-level (also the default), outside any audited repository

# one-liner (convenience), same target:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solanabr/auditor-skill/main/install.sh | bash -s -- ~/.claude/skills/auditor-skill
```

### Option 3: Clone manually

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solanabr/auditor-skill.git ~/.claude/skills/auditor-skill
```

Claude Code auto-discovers user-level skills under `~/.claude/skills/`; invoke by asking your agent to "audit this repo using the auditor-skill" (use **Option 1** for the `/auditor:*` slash commands; Claude Code 2.1.157 and later also loads this clone as the `auditor` plugin, commands included, unless managed settings block plugins saved there, with `strictPluginOnlyCustomization` or a `strictKnownMarketplaces` list without `skills-dir`, or an `auditor` plugin installed from a marketplace takes precedence). This is also Option 2's default path, so a later `install.sh` run without a path upgrades this clone: it installs a fresh clone and moves this one to Option 2's backup directory, without running git in it. For other agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Codex), copy the folder anywhere the agent reads outside the repository you audit, and point it at its `SKILL.md`.

### Option 4: Feed files to the API directly

If you're building a service, send `SKILL.md` + `OUTPUT-RULES.md` + `FULL-AUDIT.md` as system context and the target repo files as user content to any LLM API.

### Tool execution (Trail of Bits) + optional Rust tools

auditor-skill vendors **Trail of Bits** ([trailofbits/skills](https://github.com/trailofbits/skills), CC-BY-SA 4.0) as a git submodule (`vendor/trailofbits`) for real tool execution — SAST, fuzzing, coverage, mutation. Options 1 and 2 both fetch it. For Option 3, or any other clone, run this from the auditor-skill directory (not your project root):

```bash
git submodule update --init --depth 1 -- vendor/trailofbits
```

**Pinned at** [`1f68e03`](https://github.com/trailofbits/skills/tree/1f68e03536f7980d4c0e6869596f708043a19443) — trailofbits/skills `main` of 2026-10-15. Upstream publishes no tags or releases, so the pin is a commit, and it moves only after a reviewed bump ([CONTRIBUTING.md §5](CONTRIBUTING.md#5-tooling-changes)); CI fails if this line and the submodule disagree, and plugin installs receive a new pin with the next release. To read the pin of any checkout without initializing the submodule: `git ls-tree HEAD vendor/trailofbits`.

The native corpus works fully **without** it (it falls back to grep-based checks and notes where deeper tooling would run). With the submodule initialized, the auditor delegates to the vendored tools per [`references/orchestration/boundary-map.md`](references/orchestration/boundary-map.md). For the optional token-efficiency tools (`audit-scan` pre-scanner + `audit-mem` memory), build the Rust CLIs (`<auditor-skill root>` is where you installed auditor-skill):

```bash
cd "<auditor-skill root>/tools/auditor-tools" && cargo build --release --locked
```

Build them again after every update, with `cargo build --release --locked` in the same directory: the flows call them with a contract marker (`--contract=1`) that an older build refuses, and until then they go on as if the tools were absent. The auditor runs them, the scripts and the Trail of Bits plugins by absolute path from the installation, never by a path relative to the project it audits ([OUTPUT-RULES.md Rule 11e](OUTPUT-RULES.md#11e--bundled-paths)). If the installation sits inside the repository under audit anyway (such as `.claude/skills/auditor-skill`, where `install.sh` without a path installed through 7.6.0), the build runs inside that tree, where cargo and rustup read its `.cargo/config*` and `rust-toolchain*` from every parent directory: build there only in [Rule 11a](OUTPUT-RULES.md#rule-11-operating-safety) isolated mode, or delete that copy and install a fresh one outside (the plugin, or Option 2 with the path `~/.claude/skills/auditor-skill`) and build that one. Never move or update a copy you find inside a repository ([Installation](#installation)).

### Permissions and isolation

The `/auditor:*` commands run their bundled steps without asking: the working-tree check, run directories, read-only git, the Rust tools, and the runners that build and test the project in the execution mode you chose at intake. Each of these checks its own arguments, takes paths inside the working tree (the PoC build cache aside), and writes only into run directories, the `audit-mem` store and scratch directories outside the tree, besides the toolchain caches its downloads fill. Other calls ask, apart from Claude Code's own read-only commands and the file reads the commands pre-approve (Read, Grep and Glob, for any path). Two settings make a run smooth and safe, but for [one risk the first adds](docs/permissions-and-isolation.md#what-remains-a-risk), since its rules also let Claude start a flow by itself:

- Add the `Skill(auditor:… *)` rules from [docs/permissions-and-isolation.md](docs/permissions-and-isolation.md#turns-and-resuming) to your user settings, `~/.claude/settings.json`, so a flow resumes after your reply without a prompt. They name no path.
- For code you don't trust, choose isolated mode at intake, set `AUDITOR_EXEC_MODE=isolated`, and run in a container, a VM or Claude Code's sandbox. In native mode the project's builds and tests run on your machine without a prompt for each run.

## Before Running an Audit

### Scope-Gated Intake (v5.0)

auditor-skill does not bulk-read its whole corpus. It discovers the repo, declares an audit scope ([OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) Rule 0), and loads only the in-scope checklists and vectors on demand:

- root docs + `OUTPUT-RULES.md` (always),
- only the `checklists/*.md` the detected languages require (e.g. `14-python-safety.md` only if `.py` is present),
- a `known-vectors/*.md` file only when its phase + language trigger reaches it,
- `discovery/*.md` and `templates/*.md` lazily, at the phase that uses them.

The audit is complete when every **in-scope** item has an explicit verdict; out-of-scope items render `[N/A — out of scope]` from the gate.

1. **Fill out the questionnaire:** Copy [QUESTIONS.md](QUESTIONS.md) and answer all questions. This tells the auditor what checklists to apply, what severity calibration to use, and what compliance frameworks matter.

2. **Review estimated costs:** Check [COSTS.md](COSTS.md) for token/dollar estimates based on your repo size and chosen model.

3. **Choose your scope:**

| Scope | What It Covers | Estimated Time (50K lines) |
|-------|---------------|---------------------------|
| FULL | Everything — all 20 checklists + 140 vectors | 60-90 min |
| PROGRAM | Smart contract only (checklists 01-07) | 20-35 min |
| BACKEND | Backend API (checklists 08-09) | 15-25 min |
| FRONTEND | Frontend (checklists 08, 10) | 15-25 min |
| DEVOPS | Infra + supply chain (checklists 11-13) | 10-15 min |
| QUICK | Known vectors only (grep-based scan) | 5-10 min |

## Audit Flows

Beyond one-shot `/audit`, two flows run a full audit-company lifecycle end-to-end:

- **`/auditor:audit-cycle`** — a **fully automated** audit-agent team (scope → context reconstruction → tool-assisted pass → parallel manual review with leaf-level false-positive gating → independent peer reconciliation → synthesis) that produces a professional client report at `audit_<n>/REPORT.md`. Optional PDF (needs [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)):
  ```bash
  # from your project; <auditor-skill root> is where auditor-skill is installed
  "<auditor-skill root>/scripts/report-to-pdf.sh" audit_1/REPORT.md   # writes REPORT.pdf if pandoc is installed; MD is always the deliverable
  ```
- **`/auditor:audit-assist`** — an **AI-assisted, human-in-the-loop** flow: it pauses at checkpoints to surface findings and ask the questions only you can answer (business context, trust model, severity calls), iterating until the audit document converges.
- **`/auditor:re-audit`** — **fix-review**: diffs against a prior report (`FIXED` / `STILL-OPEN` / `REGRESSED`) and sweeps for un-patched siblings of each fixed bug.

Every intermediary step is also addressable on its own: `/auditor:intake` (persisted scoping), `/auditor:threat-model` (asset/actor/trust-boundary artifact; `--bootstrap` seeds it from git history, a fork parent, prior audits and incidents), `/auditor:triage` (dedup + false-positive calibration), and `/auditor:poc` / `/auditor:patch` (executable exploit + verified fix). Full command reference: [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md).

The client report follows professional firm convention — executive summary, commit-pinned scope, findings with PoC/reachability, a code-maturity assessment, disclaimers. Like real firms, it does **not** issue a "safe to deploy" guarantee. Method + firm coverage: [references/audit-lifecycle/](references/audit-lifecycle/).

## Output Format

The audit produces a structured markdown report with:

1. **Executive Summary** — risk score (1-10), deploy/no-deploy verdict, severity distribution
2. **Instruction Matrix** — every smart contract instruction mapped
3. **State Model** — account structs, PDA seeds, relationships
4. **Per-Item Verdicts** — every in-scope checklist item (up to 1,459) with `[PASS]`, `[FAIL-N]`, `[PARTIAL]`, or `[N/A]`
5. **Known Vectors Results** — each in-scope attack vector (up to 140) with explicit verdict and evidence
6. **Findings** — deduplicated, severity-sorted
7. **Attack Scenarios** — narrative exploitable paths
8. **Aggregate Score** — PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL percentages
9. **Recommendations** — prioritized fix list

For High/Critical findings, an optional `audit_<n>/poc/` (runnable exploits that assert the bug) and `audit_<n>/patches/` (minimal fixes proven to revert the exploit) accompany the report — see [docs/poc-and-patches.md](docs/poc-and-patches.md).

See [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) for the complete specification.

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first — branch + PR flow (nothing lands on `main` directly), the corpus-count consistency rule enforced by `scripts/check-corpus.sh` in CI, and the no-AI-attribution commit policy (enable the hook with `git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks`).

### Adding a New Attack Vector

1. Create `known-vectors/NNN-short-name.md` with the next available number
2. Use this template:

```markdown
---
id: NNN
title: "Your Attack Name"
severity: 7
category: crypto|backend|frontend|devops
---

### NNN — Your Attack Name
**Severity: 7** | **Real: Example Incident ($X, Year)**

Brief description of the attack.

#### Verification Procedure

**Step 1: Description**
\```
grep command or check to perform
\```
- ✅ PASS: What passing looks like
- ❌ FAIL: What failing looks like

**Step 2: ...**
(continue with 3-12 steps)

**Overall verdict:**
- ✅: Full mitigation criteria
- ⚠️: Partial mitigation criteria
- ❌: Vulnerability criteria
```

3. Add the entry to [known-vectors/INDEX.md](known-vectors/INDEX.md)
4. Submit a PR

### Adding Checklist Items

1. Open the relevant checklist in `checklists/`
2. Add new items following the existing format (ID prefix + sequential number)
3. Update the item count in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md)

### Updating Cost Estimates

If model pricing changes, update [COSTS.md](COSTS.md) with new rates.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this replace a professional audit?**
A: It covers more items than most paid audits (1,459 plus 140 known-vector checks vs typical 50-200), but an AI auditor cannot do everything a human can (social engineering assessment, business logic review requiring domain expertise, legal compliance opinions). Use this as a first pass, then hire humans for what it flags.

**Q: Which AI model should I use?**
A: See [COSTS.md](COSTS.md). For maximum depth, use Opus 4 or o3. For best value, use Sonnet 4 or GPT-4.1. For CI/CD integration (fast, cheap), use Haiku or o4-mini.

**Q: How long does an audit take?**
A: Depends on repo size and model. A 50K-line repo takes 60-90 minutes with Opus 4. See [COSTS.md](COSTS.md) for full estimates.

**Q: Can I use this in CI/CD?**
A: Yes — run the QUICK scope (known vectors grep scan) on every PR, and FULL scope on release branches. On a public repository the job posts pass/fail only — no finding counts: logs and uploaded artifacts are readable by any signed-in GitHub user, so finding details go to a private channel (OUTPUT-RULES Rule 11d). A CI job is a `claude -p` run: it denies every call that would ask. The QUICK scope builds nothing; a FULL run builds the project natively unless the job sets `AUDITOR_EXEC_MODE` (see [docs/permissions-and-isolation.md](docs/permissions-and-isolation.md#non-interactive-runs-claude--p)). Run it on a clean copy, with `--setting-sources user`: a pull request can carry `.claude/settings.json` hooks and a `.mcp.json` that `claude -p` runs when it starts.

**Q: Can I use this for non-Solana projects?**
A: Yes — checklists 08-18 are language-agnostic or cover Python/Go/Java/Ruby/PHP. Checklists 01-07 are Solana-specific.
