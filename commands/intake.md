name: auditor:intake
description: Interactive engagement intake (alias /scope). Walks QUESTIONS.md and persists the answers to audit_<n>/intake.md — the durable intake artifact both audit-cycle and audit-assist read, instead of answers living only in conversation state. Captures scope + commit pin, languages/frameworks, protocol class, compliance, severity calibration, the trust-model inputs that feed the report's Trust Model and Assumptions sections, and the execution mode for target-controlled code (OUTPUT-RULES Rule 11a). Interactive mode asks; automated mode records the applied default.

# auditor-skill — Engagement Intake / Scope

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

Turn the passive `QUESTIONS.md` questionnaire into a **persisted** `audit_<n>/intake.md`. Read `QUESTIONS.md` first (the source questions + the "How Answers Affect the Audit" table) and `templates/intake.md` (the artifact you fill). This fixes the gap where intake answers lived only in conversation state — both `/auditor:audit-cycle` and `/auditor:audit-assist` read the file you write here.

## Mode

- **Interactive (default)** — walk the human through the questions. Ask sharp, answerable questions; do not dump all 47 at once. Group by section, skip questions the repo already answers (detected language, framework), confirm rather than re-ask.
- **`--auto`** — no human present (the `audit-cycle` path). Apply the `QUESTIONS.md` default for every unanswered question and record each under **Assumed Defaults (Unanswered)** with the exact default applied. Never leave a field blank; never assume silently. Live probes (`Q47`) are always **no** in this mode.

## Steps

1. **Discover.** Enumerate the repo (extensions, `Anchor.toml` / `Cargo.toml` / `package.json` / `.github/`). Pre-fill languages, framework, monorepo shape, and DEX/oracle/CPI hints from what the code shows — do not ask what the code already answers.

2. **Pin the commit.** `git rev-parse HEAD`. Record the full 40-char SHA and branch so the report names exactly what was reviewed.

3. **Warm from prior audits (if available).** If the bundled tools are built (`test -x "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/auditor-tools/target/release/audit-mem"`), warm only after the store check of `OUTPUT-RULES.md` Rule 11d passes. In the audited repository, `GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1 git --no-pager -c core.fsmonitor=false --icase-pathspecs ls-files -- .audit-memory` must print nothing and exit 0, and the store must be one you created. Any output, in any letter case, or any error means: do not use that store; use a fresh one outside the target tree, passing `--db <path outside the tree>` to every `audit-mem` call. Run the check before creating `.audit-memory/.gitignore` and again before every `audit-mem` use: a later pull can change the answer. For the in-tree store, run `mkdir -p .audit-memory && printf '*\n' > .audit-memory/.gitignore` first (`audit-mem` creates the directory itself). Then `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/auditor-tools/target/release/audit-mem" warm --program-id <id>` (by that absolute path, never a relative `tools/` one) injects the prior protocol profile and open false-positive rulings — pre-fill from it and confirm rather than re-ask. Record the store's path in `intake.md` §1; later steps pass that path explicitly (`/auditor:threat-model` hands it to its collector as `--audit-mem-db`). If absent, skip.

4. **Walk QUESTIONS.md → intake.md.** Fill every section of `templates/intake.md`:
   - **Scope & commit pin** — in/out of scope (honor `Q44` excludes), `--scope` boundary.
   - **Languages & frameworks** (`Q3`–`Q7`) — drives the scope-gated checklist set (`SKILL.md` → SCOPE-GATED LOADING).
   - **Protocol class** (`Q1`, `Q17`–`Q24`) — gates checklist 06 + economic known-vectors when funds are handled.
   - **Compliance** (`Q35`–`Q38`) — gates checklist 18.
   - **Severity calibration** (`Q8`, `Q10`, `Q11`, `Q40`–`Q41`) — record the concrete lever applied (mainnet → +1 on fund findings; TVL > $1M → double-weight criticals; single-wallet upgrade authority → auto Severity 8+), per the QUESTIONS.md effects table. Feeds report §5.
   - **Trust-model inputs (critical)** (`Q11`, `Q14`–`Q16`, `Q23`) — for each of admin / upgrade authority / oracle / keeper / LP / permissionless user, record who holds it, what they can do, and what the review trusts them **NOT** to do. "Untrusted / permissionless" is a valid, important answer. This seeds report §4.4 and §4.6, and is the actor list `/auditor:threat-model` expands.
   - **Security history** (`Q25`–`Q28`).

5. **Execution mode (`Q46`).** Ask once per audit where target-controlled code may run — **isolated** (recommended: container, VM, or Claude Code sandbox with no keys or credentials mounted) or **native** (the auditor's own machine) — per `OUTPUT-RULES.md` Rule 11a. Record the mode and the isolation used in §8 of `intake.md`; every later step that builds, tests or installs the target, or builds a PoC, uses it. Also write the answer with the Write tool, as one word, `isolated` or `native`, to `audit_<n>/exec-mode`, once step 8 has made `audit_<n>/` and its `.gitignore`: `templates/poc/run.sh --crate` and `/auditor:patch`'s post-patch validation take the stricter of that file and `AUDITOR_EXEC_MODE`. Also tell the human that tools which send code, dependency names or addresses to outside services are listed in the report rather than gated (Rule 11b). In `--auto`, an unanswered `Q46` is recorded as **native** in **Assumed Defaults** with the basis "Rule 11a default when no mode is recorded", and `audit_<n>/exec-mode` holds `native` — and the report then states that target code ran on the auditor's machine.

6. **Live probes (`Q47`).** Ask once whether DEP-072 and DEP-073 may probe the project's own live hosts and buckets: read-only and unauthenticated, and only hosts and buckets the human names, or that the repository's own deployment config names and the human confirms: show each host or bucket found in the repository's deployment config with its file and line, and list only those the client confirms; nothing found later is added. Never a third-party service (`QUESTIONS.md` Q47). Record the answer and those hosts and buckets under Live probes in §8 of `intake.md`, each exactly as the grammar in Q47 allows; the probes run for nothing else. In `--auto`, or when Q47 is unanswered, record **no** in **Assumed Defaults** with the basis "QUESTIONS.md Q47: no live probes without a human's yes"; those items then give the owner a command to run instead.

7. **Record assumed defaults.** In `--auto`, every unanswered question goes in the **Assumed Defaults (Unanswered)** table with the default applied and its basis. Each entry is carried into the report's **§4.6 Assumptions & Simplifications** as an explicit assumption — so "no finding here" reads against a stated default, not a blanket clearance. In interactive mode this table should be empty (everything was asked); if non-empty, it lists only what the human explicitly deferred.

8. **Write `audit_<n>/intake.md`.** `<n>` is the highest existing `audit_*` number + 1 (`OUTPUT-RULES.md` Rule 11d); create the dir with `mkdir` (not `mkdir -p`) and stop if it exists. Reuse an existing `audit_*` only if git does not track it (`GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1 git --no-pager -c core.fsmonitor=false --icase-pathspecs ls-files -- audit_<n>` prints nothing and exits 0) and it holds no symbolic links (`find audit_<n> -type l` prints nothing and exits 0), and only after the human confirms which one. Never write into a tracked `audit_*`. The directory's first file is a `.gitignore` containing `*` (Rule 11d); `exec-mode` (step 5) goes next to `intake.md`. This file is the intake of record.

## Output

`audit_<n>/intake.md` — the persisted intake artifact. Confirm the path and note whether it was filled interactively or from defaults. Both flows read this file at their scope/intake step.
