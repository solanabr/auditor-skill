description: Interactive engagement intake (alias /scope). Walks QUESTIONS.md and persists the answers to audit_<n>/intake.md — the durable intake artifact both audit-cycle and audit-assist read, instead of answers living only in conversation state. Captures scope + commit pin, languages/frameworks, protocol class, compliance, severity calibration, the trust-model inputs that feed the report's Trust Model and Assumptions sections, and the execution mode for target-controlled code (OUTPUT-RULES Rule 11a). Interactive mode asks; automated mode records the applied default.

# auditor-skill — Engagement Intake / Scope

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

Turn the passive `QUESTIONS.md` questionnaire into a **persisted** `audit_<n>/intake.md`. Read `QUESTIONS.md` first (the source questions + the "How Answers Affect the Audit" table) and `templates/intake.md` (the artifact you fill). This fixes the gap where intake answers lived only in conversation state — both `/auditor:audit-cycle` and `/auditor:audit-assist` read the file you write here.

## Mode

- **Interactive (default)** — walk the human through the questions. Ask sharp, answerable questions; do not dump all 46 at once. Group by section, skip questions the repo already answers (detected language, framework), confirm rather than re-ask.
- **`--auto`** — no human present (the `audit-cycle` path). Apply the `QUESTIONS.md` default for every unanswered question and record each under **Assumed Defaults (Unanswered)** with the exact default applied. Never leave a field blank; never assume silently.

## Steps

1. **Discover.** Enumerate the repo (extensions, `Anchor.toml` / `Cargo.toml` / `package.json` / `.github/`). Pre-fill languages, framework, monorepo shape, and DEX/oracle/CPI hints from what the code shows — do not ask what the code already answers.

2. **Pin the commit.** `git rev-parse HEAD`. Record the full 40-char SHA and branch so the report names exactly what was reviewed.

3. **Warm from prior audits (if available).** If the bundled tools are built (`test -x "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/auditor-tools/target/release/audit-mem"`), warm only after the store check of `OUTPUT-RULES.md` Rule 11d passes: an existing `.audit-memory/` counts only if the audited repository does not track it (`git ls-files .audit-memory` prints nothing) and you created it; otherwise use a fresh store outside the target tree, passing `--db <path outside the tree>` to every `audit-mem` call. For the in-tree store, run `mkdir -p .audit-memory && printf '*\n' > .audit-memory/.gitignore` first (`audit-mem` creates the directory itself). Then `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/tools/auditor-tools/target/release/audit-mem" warm --program-id <id>` (by that absolute path, never a relative `tools/` one) injects the prior protocol profile and open false-positive rulings — pre-fill from it and confirm rather than re-ask. Record the store's path in `intake.md` §1; later steps pass that path explicitly (`/auditor:threat-model` hands it to its collector as `--audit-mem-db`). If absent, skip.

4. **Walk QUESTIONS.md → intake.md.** Fill every section of `templates/intake.md`:
   - **Scope & commit pin** — in/out of scope (honor `Q44` excludes), `--scope` boundary.
   - **Languages & frameworks** (`Q3`–`Q7`) — drives the scope-gated checklist set (`SKILL.md` → SCOPE-GATED LOADING).
   - **Protocol class** (`Q1`, `Q17`–`Q24`) — gates checklist 06 + economic known-vectors when funds are handled.
   - **Compliance** (`Q35`–`Q38`) — gates checklist 18.
   - **Severity calibration** (`Q8`, `Q10`, `Q11`, `Q40`–`Q41`) — record the concrete lever applied (mainnet → +1 on fund findings; TVL > $1M → double-weight criticals; single-wallet upgrade authority → auto Severity 8+), per the QUESTIONS.md effects table. Feeds report §5.
   - **Trust-model inputs (critical)** (`Q11`, `Q14`–`Q16`, `Q23`) — for each of admin / upgrade authority / oracle / keeper / LP / permissionless user, record who holds it, what they can do, and what the review trusts them **NOT** to do. "Untrusted / permissionless" is a valid, important answer. This seeds report §4.4 and §4.6, and is the actor list `/auditor:threat-model` expands.
   - **Security history** (`Q25`–`Q28`).

5. **Execution mode (`Q46`).** Ask once per audit where target-controlled code may run — **isolated** (recommended: container, VM, or Claude Code sandbox with no keys or credentials mounted) or **native** (the auditor's own machine) — per `OUTPUT-RULES.md` Rule 11a. Record the mode and the isolation used in §8 of `intake.md`; every later step that builds, tests or installs the target uses it. Also tell the human that tools which send code, dependency names or addresses to outside services are listed in the report rather than gated (Rule 11b). In `--auto`, an unanswered `Q46` is recorded as **native** in **Assumed Defaults** with the basis "Rule 11a default when no mode is recorded" — and the report then states that target code ran on the auditor's machine.

6. **Record assumed defaults.** In `--auto`, every unanswered question goes in the **Assumed Defaults (Unanswered)** table with the default applied and its basis. Each entry is carried into the report's **§4.6 Assumptions & Simplifications** as an explicit assumption — so "no finding here" reads against a stated default, not a blanket clearance. In interactive mode this table should be empty (everything was asked); if non-empty, it lists only what the human explicitly deferred.

7. **Write `audit_<n>/intake.md`.** `<n>` is the highest existing `audit_*` number + 1 (`OUTPUT-RULES.md` Rule 9); create the dir with `mkdir` (not `mkdir -p`) and stop if it exists. Reuse an existing `audit_*` only if git does not track it (`git ls-files -- audit_<n>` prints nothing; Rule 11c flags in a checkout you did not clone) and it holds no symbolic links (`find audit_<n> -type l` prints nothing). Never write into a tracked `audit_*`. The directory's first file is a `.gitignore` containing `*` (Rule 11d). This file is the intake of record.

## Output

`audit_<n>/intake.md` — the persisted intake artifact. Confirm the path and note whether it was filled interactively or from defaults. Both flows read this file at their scope/intake step.
