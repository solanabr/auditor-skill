# auditor-skill — Economic Simulation

**Arguments:** $ARGUMENTS

1. Model the attack: capital / setup cost, extractable value, atomicity (single-tx / multi-slot), flash-loanable ceilings per venue.
2. Compute whether profit > cost at any manipulation level (e.g. cost to move spot price 1 / 5 / 10 %).
3. If a Surfpool mainnet-fork is available, reproduce the sequence against forked pool state and record the net P/L.
4. Produce the quantified PoC that Rule 5b requires for High / Critical economic findings — dollar figures, not yes/no.
