# Full Repository Audit — Master Execution Plan

> This document is the step-by-step execution plan for auditing an entire repository.  
> The auditor agent reads this file and follows it from top to bottom, producing a complete report.
>
> **MANDATORY**: Read [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) FIRST — it defines the severity scale (1-10),
> the chunked execution protocol, the executive summary format, and the item-by-item output requirement.
> Every rule in OUTPUT-RULES.md overrides anything in this document if there's a conflict.

---

## PRE-FLIGHT

Before starting any phase:
1. Read [OUTPUT-RULES.md](OUTPUT-RULES.md) — the output format is non-negotiable
2. Run discovery and declare the audit SCOPE (Rule 0 in OUTPUT-RULES.md) — do NOT bulk-read the corpus
3. Load only the in-scope checklists/vectors, on demand as each phase reaches them
4. Detect languages in the repo (Rule 7 in OUTPUT-RULES.md) — this determines which checklists to apply
5. Create a session checkpoint file to track progress across chunks (Rule 3 in OUTPUT-RULES.md)
6. Remember: **walk the code file by file — never one-shot** (Rule 3)
7. Apply **Operating Safety** ([OUTPUT-RULES.md Rule 11](OUTPUT-RULES.md#rule-11-operating-safety)) before anything runs: take the execution mode recorded at intake (11a — isolated recommended, native allowed with a report caveat), list every outside service a tool contacts (11b), treat a `.git/` you did not clone yourself as untrusted (11c), and make `.gitignore` containing `*` the first file in `audit_<n>/` (11d)
8. Resolve every bundled path in this file (`tools/`, `templates/`, `scripts/`, `vendor/trailofbits/`, the corpus) from the auditor-skill root, never the working directory, which is the audited repo ([Rule 11e](OUTPUT-RULES.md#11e--bundled-paths)). The root is the absolute path the skill (`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`) or command (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`) gave you; nothing is filled in here, so it is written `<auditor-skill root>` below. The executables this plan runs: `"<auditor-skill root>/tools/auditor-tools/target/release/audit-scan"`, `"<auditor-skill root>/tools/auditor-tools/target/release/audit-mem"`, and the Trail of Bits plugins when `test -d "<auditor-skill root>/vendor/trailofbits/plugins"` succeeds

---

## PHASE -1: SCOPE DECLARATION

Declare scope per OUTPUT-RULES Rule 0 + SKILL Scope-Gated Loading; record the Scope Coverage table below (per checklist/vector group: in-scope yes/no + trigger).

| Checklist / vector group | In scope? | Trigger |
|--------------------------|-----------|---------|
| 01–07 on-chain | yes/no | `.rs` / `Anchor.toml` |
| 08–10 off-chain (TS/web) | yes/no | `.ts` / `.tsx` |
| 14 python | yes/no | `.py` |
| 15 general language | yes/no | `.go`/`.java`/`.rb`/`.php` |
| 19 AI-agent | yes/no | `.mcp.json` / agent SDK |
| 20 off-chain Rust | yes/no | `.rs` outside `programs/` |
| 11–13, 16–18 universal | yes | any repo |

---

## PHASE 0: SETUP

### 0.1 — Identify the Repository

```
ACTION: Read the following files to establish context:
  - Anchor.toml (program ID, cluster, provider)
  - Cargo.toml (workspace members, Anchor version, Solana version)
  - package.json (root, all workspaces — dependencies, scripts)
  - .gitignore (verify secrets excluded)
  - README.md (project description, architecture)

RECORD:
  - Program ID: ___
  - Anchor version: ___
  - Solana SDK version: ___
  - Node.js dependencies count: ___
  - Git branch: ___
  - Git commit hash: ___
```

### 0.2 — Map the Codebase

```
ACTION: Use the in-scope paths recorded at intake (audit_<n>/intake.md §1, Q39/Q44), else the defaults in discovery/file-map.md, OR auto-discover:
  1. List all .rs files under programs/
  2. List all .ts/.tsx files under apps/backend/src/
  3. List all .ts/.tsx files under apps/web/src/
  4. List all package.json files in the monorepo
  5. List all .env* files (should be in .gitignore)
  6. List all config files (tsconfig, anchor, cargo, turbo, etc.)

RECORD:
  - Total Rust files: ___
  - Total TS/TSX files: ___
  - Total instruction handlers: ___
  - Total API endpoints (backend routes + frontend API routes): ___
```

### 0.3 — Build Instruction Matrix

> **Optional deterministic pre-pass.** If the bundled tools are built (`test -x "<auditor-skill root>/tools/auditor-tools/target/release/audit-scan"`, PRE-FLIGHT 8), run `"<auditor-skill root>/tools/auditor-tools/target/release/audit-scan" <program-path> --out audit_<n>/prescan.json` first — it emits this instruction matrix (plus the account-constraint, PDA-seed, arithmetic, and CPI tables) deterministically at ~$0, so Phase 0.2–0.4 collapse to *reading the JSON* and files with zero scan hits get a spot-check instead of a full read. Also run `"<auditor-skill root>/tools/auditor-tools/target/release/audit-mem" warm --program-id <id>` to load prior invariants + open false-positive rulings, but only after the Rule 11d store check passes: use `.audit-memory/` only if the repository does not track it (`GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1 git --no-pager -c core.fsmonitor=false --icase-pathspecs ls-files -- .audit-memory` prints nothing and exits 0; any output, in any letter case, or any error means: do not use that store) and you created it, writing `mkdir -p .audit-memory && printf '*\n' > .audit-memory/.gitignore` first; otherwise pass `--db <path outside the tree>` for a fresh store. Treat all pre-scan output as a *map to verify*, never as verdicts. See [references/orchestration/pre-scan.md](references/orchestration/pre-scan.md). Absent the toolchain, build the matrix by hand below.

```
ACTION: Read lib.rs → list every #[instruction] or pub fn handler.
For EACH instruction, read the instruction file and record:

| Instruction | Signer | has_one constraints | CPIs | Arithmetic ops | State mutations |
|-------------|--------|-------------------|------|----------------|-----------------|
| ...         | ...    | ...               | ...  | ...            | ...             |

Save this matrix — it's used by checklists 01-06.
```

### 0.4 — Build State Model

```
ACTION: Read every file in state/ directory. For each account struct, record:

| Account | Seeds | Size | Key fields | Mutable by |
|---------|-------|------|------------|------------|
| ...     | ...   | ...  | ...        | ...        |

Map relationships: which accounts reference which.
Identify all enums and their variants.
```

---

## PHASE 0.5: CONTEXT RECONSTRUCTION (before any verdict)

Build understanding before judgment. No checklist item may be marked `[FAIL-N≥6]` against a function that has not first been reconstructed here. *(Pattern credit: Trail of Bits `audit-context-building`.)*

For every non-trivial function (any instruction handler, any value-moving or state-mutating fn, any fn with a CPI or arithmetic), fill `templates/context-worksheet.md`:

- **Purpose** — what the function is supposed to do, from the code (not the docs).
- **Signature** — inputs (args), accounts (+ constraints), state written, each `@ L#`.
- **Block-by-block** — what each block does, what it reads / writes, why it is there.
- **≥ 3 invariants** it must preserve · **≥ 5 assumptions** about inputs / accounts / caller · **≥ 3 external-interaction risks** (CPIs, sysvars, `remaining_accounts`, oracle reads).
- **Cross-function dependencies** — shared state, ordering assumptions.

Anti-hallucination rules (mandatory):

- Every claim cites a line (`L#`).
- The words "probably", "might", "seems", "should" are banned. If you cannot state it from the code, write `UNKNOWN — needs manual review`.
- Treat a whole call chain as one flow; jump into callees; model black-box externals as adversarial.

Output worksheets to `audit_<n>/worksheets/context/{fn}.md`. These feed the Rule 5b validation gate.

---

## PHASE 1: ON-CHAIN PROGRAM AUDIT (Checklists 01-06)

### Execution Strategy

The on-chain audit proceeds **instruction-by-instruction**. For each instruction file:

1. Open the file
2. Run items from checklists 01 (account validation), 02 (access control), 03 (arithmetic), 04 (CPI/PDA) that apply
3. Record findings inline

After all instructions are reviewed individually, run the **cross-cutting** checks:
- Checklist 05 (state machine) — requires full lifecycle view
- Checklist 06 (economic/logic) — requires understanding of all instructions together

### Step 1.1 — Per-Instruction Deep Review

```
FOR EACH instruction file in programs/*/src/instructions/:

  READ the full file (accounts struct + handler function)

  CHECK (from 01-account-validation):
    - Every account type (AccountInfo vs UncheckedAccount vs Account<T>)
    - Every /// CHECK: comment has real validation
    - has_one constraints present and correct
    - seeds + bump for PDA accounts
    - remaining_accounts validation (if used)

  CHECK (from 02-access-control):
    - Signer present for value-moving operations
    - Signer linked to state via has_one
    - Role appropriate (manager/investor/delegate/permissionless)

  CHECK (from 03-arithmetic):
    - Every +, -, *, / operator — is it checked_*?
    - u128 intermediate for multiply-then-divide
    - Division by zero guards
    - Truncation safety (u128 → u64, u64 → u32)

  CHECK (from 04-cpi-pda):
    - CpiContext first arg is Pubkey (Anchor 1.0)
    - CPI targets validated (program ID)
    - from/to/authority/amount correct in each CPI
    - invoke_signed uses correct seeds
    - State mutations BEFORE CPI (checks-effects-interactions)

  RECORD: findings per instruction file
```

### Step 1.2 — Cross-Cutting State Machine Review (Checklist 05)

```
AFTER all individual instructions reviewed:

  1. Draw the withdrawal/redeem lifecycle from code (not docs)
     - Which instruction sets each status variant? (adapt to your status enum name)
     - Are all transitions present? Any dead variants?
     - Can withdrawals get stuck?

  2. Draw the overall protocol lifecycle
     - Creation → deposits → operations → withdrawals → (closure?)
     - Can every created account reach a terminal state?

  3. Verify invariants
     - total_shares == shares_mint.supply
     - total_shares == Σ(investor_position.shares)
     - Event emission for every financial operation

  RECORD: lifecycle diagrams + findings
```

### Step 1.3 — Economic & Logic Attack Review (Checklist 06)

```
AFTER understanding all instructions:

  1. Flash loan attack paths
  2. Sandwich/MEV attack paths
  3. First depositor attack scenario
  4. NAV manipulation scenarios
  5. Fee exploitation vectors
  6. Manager rug pull analysis
  7. Token-specific exploits
  8. DoS attack vectors

  RECORD: attack scenario descriptions + findings
```

## PHASE 2: OFF-CHAIN CODE AUDIT (Checklists 08-10)

### Step 2.1 — TypeScript Safety Sweep (Checklist 08)

```
AUTOMATED GREP COMMANDS (run all):

  # any type ban

  grep -rn "@ts-ignore\|@ts-nocheck" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" apps/

  RECORD: every match with file:line
```

### Step 2.2 — Backend Security Review (Checklist 09)

```
FOR EACH route file in apps/backend/src/routes/:

  READ the full file

  CHECK:
    - Auth middleware applied (wallet signature verification)
    - Zod schema for request body
    - MongoDB queries use validated input (no raw injection)
    - On-chain verification for financial records
    - Error handling (no empty catches, no stack traces exposed)

FOR middleware/:
    - Auth: signature verification logic correct
    - Rate limiter: configured for all environments
    - Error handler: no stack traces in production

FOR services/:
    - Solana RPC: uses env var, correct commitment
    - Jupiter: API key from env, correct endpoints
    - PnL: arithmetic correctness

FOR index.ts (server entry):
    - Helmet configured
    - CORS whitelist (not *)
    - Env var validation at startup
    - Rate limiting enabled

RECORD: findings per file
```

### Step 2.3 — Frontend Security Review (Checklist 10)

```
AUTOMATED GREP COMMANDS:

  # XSS vectors
  grep -rn "dangerouslySetInnerHTML" --include="*.tsx" apps/web/
  grep -rn "document.write" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" apps/web/

  # Secret exposure
  grep -rn "NEXT_PUBLIC_" apps/web/src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
  # → verify NONE are secrets

  # Console in production
  grep -rn "console.log" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" apps/web/src/

FOR EACH API route in apps/web/src/app/api/:
  CHECK:
    - Body parsing in try-catch
    - Required field validation
    - Proxy response handling (text then parse)
    - Error status codes (400/401/502, not 500)

FOR EACH page/component:
  SPOT-CHECK:
    - next/image usage (not raw <img>)
    - Wallet state cleanup on disconnect
    - Transaction simulation before send

RECORD: findings per file
```

## PHASE 3: DEVOPS & OPERATIONS AUDIT (Checklists 07, 11-13)

### Step 3.1 — OpSec & Governance (Checklist 07)

```
ACTIONS (some require terminal):

  # Check upgrade authority
  solana program show <PROGRAM_ID> --url $SOLANA_RPC_URL

  # Check for backdoors

### Step 3.3 — Secrets Audit (Checklist 12)

```
ACTIONS:

### Step 3.4 — Deployment & Infrastructure (Checklist 13)

```
ACTIONS:

  # Both commands below run target-controlled code (build.rs, proc-macros, and
  # Anchor.toml [scripts], which `anchor test` executes). Run them in the execution
  # mode recorded at intake — OUTPUT-RULES Rule 11a (isolated recommended; native
  # allowed, with the report caveat). If they cannot run in that mode, keep the
  # source-level verdicts and add a Rule 10 confidence note.

  # Verify build
  anchor build 2>&1 | tail -20
  # Check for warnings, errors

  # Verify tests pass
  anchor test --skip-local-validator 2>&1 | tail -30

  # Check deployment config (render.yaml, fly.toml, docker-compose.yml, etc.)
  # Adapt file names to your deployment platform

  # Verify .gitignore completeness

## PHASE 4: VERIFICATION, MONITORING & COMPLIANCE AUDIT (Checklists 16-18)

### Step 4.1 — Formal Verification & Testing Quality (Checklist 16)

### Step 4.4 — Known Attack Vectors (all in-scope, KV-001..140)

Do NOT bulk-read all 140 vector files — that nullifies the scope gate. Load each in-scope vector **only when its `known-vectors/INDEX.md` trigger fires** (phase + language + the vector's feature markers), driven by the prescan advisory manifest.

```
ACTIONS:

  1. Read known-vectors/INDEX.md — use its "Load when (markers)" column as the trigger table.
  2. For EACH in-scope vector (per Phase -1 scope):
       a. If the vector's markers are `always (<phase>)` → OPEN the vector file and evaluate it.
       b. Else check its feature markers against evidence:
            - the audit-scan prescan array (references/orchestration/pre-scan.md), and
            - a grep over the in-scope tree.
          If EVERY marker is PROVABLY ABSENT (empty prescan array OR zero grep hits) →
            record  [N/A — feature absent: <marker>]  from the gate (an evidence-backed verdict).
          Otherwise → OPEN the vector file and evaluate it.
  3. For each opened vector, record one verdict:
       [PASS] / [FAIL-{1-10}] / [PARTIAL] / [N/A]
  4. Add evidence line(s): file:line, prescan field, or command output reference.

RECORD format:
  - KV-001: [PASS] ...                             (always-load, evaluated)
  - KV-005: [N/A — feature absent: pyth/switchboard/oracle]   (skip-deferred from gate)
  ...
  - KV-136: [FAIL-7] ...

HARD RULE (completeness — OUTPUT-RULES Rule 0):
  Every in-scope KV item still has a verdict. A skip-deferred `[N/A — feature absent]` is an
  evidence-backed verdict, NOT a silent skip — and it REOPENS on demand: because the prescan
  under-reports (macros / trait dispatch, per its honesty rule), the instant a manual file read
  surfaces the missing feature (e.g. a `CpiContext` the scan missed), OPEN and evaluate that
  vector. No bug becomes unreachable. Out-of-scope vectors render
  [N/A — out of scope: <reason>] from the scope gate.

See: known-vectors/INDEX.md (Load-when trigger column) · references/orchestration/pre-scan.md
     (Evidence-driven load gating manifest).

## PHASE 4.5: MATURITY ASSESSMENT

Orthogonal to the risk score: the risk score is the *deploy gate*; this scorecard is the *engineering-quality gate*. Rate each category 0-4 (0 absent · 1 ad-hoc · 2 partial · 3 good · 4 strong), weakest-link. *(Pattern credit: Trail of Bits `code-maturity-assessor`.)*

| # | Category | Scored on |
|---|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Access Controls | signer/authority coverage, role separation, admin-key custody |
| 2 | Arithmetic | checked math, u128 intermediates, rounding discipline |
| 3 | Account & Type Safety | typed accounts, discriminator/owner checks, PDA canonicalization |
| 4 | Input Validation | bounds, allowlists, `remaining_accounts` validation |
| 5 | Testing | unit/integration coverage, LiteSVM/Mollusk, edge cases |
| 6 | Fuzzing & Property Tests | cargo-fuzz/proptest presence, documented invariants |
| 7 | Error Handling & DoS Resilience | no `unwrap()`/panic on user input, compute/stack bounds |
| 8 | Upgradeability & Governance | upgrade authority, timelock, multisig, emergency pause |
| 9 | Monitoring & Incident Response | event emission coverage, runbooks, alerting |

Emit the scorecard as a dedicated report section (see `templates/report-template.md`). Categories scoring ≤ 1 are prioritized in the Remediation Roadmap regardless of individual finding severity.

## PHASE 5: REPORT GENERATION

### Step 5.1 — Aggregate Findings

```
Collect ALL findings from Phases 1-4.
Classify each by severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / INFO
De-duplicate (same root cause appearing in multiple checklists)
```

### Step 5.2 — Generate Report

```
Use the template in templates/report-template.md
Fill in:
  - Corpus coverage section (all auditor-skill files)
  - Executive summary with counts
  - Each finding with: ID, severity, location, description, exploit scenario, fix recommendation
  - Checklist summary table
  - Detailed per-item results
  - Known vector results (KV-001 through KV-140, each in-scope one with verdict)

Save report to: audit_{N}/REPORT.md (where N is the next audit number)
```

### Step 5.3 — Generate Roadmap

```
Create a prioritized remediation roadmap:
  1. CRITICAL findings — fix immediately, block deploy
  2. HIGH findings — fix before next release
  3. MEDIUM findings — fix within 2 weeks
  4. LOW findings — address in next sprint
  5. INFO — track in backlog

Save to: audit_{N}/roadmap.md
```

## EXECUTION NOTES

### Walk The Code — Never One-Shot

Chunking (chunk sizes per surface: 1 instruction file / 1 route + service / 2-3 components) + checkpoint format → OUTPUT-RULES.md Rule 3. Save a checkpoint after each chunk; if context is lost, resume from the checkpoint's `Next Action`.

### Parallelization
- Steps 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 are independent — can run grep commands in parallel
- Steps 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 are independent
- Phase 1 must be sequential (instruction review builds context)

### Scope Control
- `FULL`: All checklists (01-18), all files
- `PROGRAM`: Checklists 01-07, 16 (on-chain + opsec + verification)
- `BACKEND`: Checklists 08-09, 11-12, 14-18 (TypeScript + backend + supply chain + secrets + verification + monitoring + compliance)
- `FRONTEND`: Checklists 08, 10, 12, 16-17 (TypeScript + frontend + secrets + verification + monitoring)
- `DEVOPS`: Checklists 07, 11-13, 16-18 (opsec + supply chain + secrets + deployment + verification + monitoring + compliance)

### Language Auto-Detection
Language → checklist mapping is authoritative in [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) → Scope-Gated Loading, Step 2 (scope table); see also OUTPUT-RULES.md Rule 7. The auditor scans file extensions/markers and applies the correct checklists.
