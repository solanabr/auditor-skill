---

## 13.1 — Program Build & Deploy

- [ ] **DEP-001**: Program built with `anchor build` — not `cargo build-sbf` directly (ensures Anchor IDL generation)
- [ ] **DEP-002**: Verifiable build: `anchor build --verifiable` or Docker-based verifiable build
- [ ] **DEP-003**: Build produces deterministic output — same source → same binary hash
- [ ] **DEP-004**: Program ID in `declare_id!()` matches `Anchor.toml` and deployed program
- [ ] **DEP-005**: `anchor build --ignore-keys` NOT used for production builds
- [ ] **DEP-006**: Legacy IDL accounts (if upgrading from Anchor 0.x) closed before deploying v1.0
- [ ] **DEP-007**: Deploy command: `solana program deploy` with appropriate options (not `anchor deploy` directly for mainnet)
- [ ] **DEP-008**: Deploy uses dedicated RPC (Helius) — not public mainnet-beta
- [ ] **DEP-009**: Deploy keypair is the correct one (verified before execution)
- [ ] **DEP-010**: Deploy buffer account — funded with sufficient SOL for the binary size
- [ ] **DEP-011**: Post-deploy verification: `anchor verify` or manual binary comparison
- [ ] **DEP-012**: IDL published: `anchor idl init/upgrade` — IDL matches deployed program

## 13.2 — Upgrade Safety

- [ ] **DEP-013**: Pre-upgrade checklist executed (all test suites pass, audit findings addressed)
- [ ] **DEP-014**: Upgrade tested on devnet before mainnet
- [ ] **DEP-015**: Account data migration plan if struct layouts changed
- [ ] **DEP-016**: Account migration tested — existing accounts can be deserialized by new program
- [ ] **DEP-017**: Anchor `Migration<'info, From, To>` account type used for struct changes
- [ ] **DEP-018**: Rollback plan documented — what to do if upgrade fails
- [ ] **DEP-019**: Multisig approval required for upgrade transaction
- [ ] **DEP-020**: Timelock period observed before upgrade execution
- [ ] **DEP-021**: Users notified of upcoming upgrade (changelog, Discord, frontend banner)
- [ ] **DEP-078**: `solana program close` / `--bypass-warning` is NOT used without a documented recovery path — closing a program account permanently locks its funds and bricks it (OptiFi $661K, Aug 2022, permanently frozen)
- [ ] **DEP-079**: Program upgrades preserve state compatibility and provide a migration/forwarding path; upgrade authority is NOT revoked mid-migration (leaving accounts undeserializable by the live program). (KB VC-36)

## 13.3 — Backend Deployment

- [ ] **DEP-022**: Backend deployed via CI/CD (not manual `ssh && git pull`)
- [ ] **DEP-023**: Health check endpoint exists and is monitored
- [ ] **DEP-024**: Zero-downtime deployment (rolling update or blue-green)
- [ ] **DEP-025**: Environment variables set in hosting platform (Render, Railway, etc.) — not in repo
- [ ] **DEP-026**: Auto-scaling configured (if traffic warrants)
- [ ] **DEP-027**: Process manager configured (PM2, systemd, or platform-native)
- [ ] **DEP-028**: Graceful shutdown: server closes connections on SIGTERM
- [ ] **DEP-029**: Database migrations run automatically or as part of deploy pipeline
- [ ] **DEP-030**: Deployment logs retained for incident investigation

## 13.4 — Frontend Deployment

- [ ] **DEP-031**: Frontend deployed via CI/CD (Vercel, Netlify, or similar)
- [ ] **DEP-032**: Build environment variables set correctly (NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars)
- [ ] **DEP-033**: Production build: `next build` succeeds without errors
- [ ] **DEP-034**: No `eslint-disable`/`ts-ignore` that masks build errors
- [ ] **DEP-035**: Source maps configuration: disabled or server-only in production
- [ ] **DEP-036**: Static assets cached with proper `Cache-Control` headers
- [ ] **DEP-037**: Custom domain with valid TLS certificate
- [ ] **DEP-038**: Redirect HTTP → HTTPS enforced

## 13.5 — Monitoring & Alerting

- [ ] **DEP-039**: Uptime monitoring: backend health check polled every 1-5 minutes
- [ ] **DEP-040**: Error rate monitoring: alerts when error rate exceeds threshold
- [ ] **DEP-041**: Response time monitoring: alerts when latency exceeds threshold
- [ ] **DEP-042**: On-chain monitoring: alerts for large value movements from fund PDAs
- [ ] **DEP-043**: On-chain monitoring: alerts for program upgrade authority changes
- [ ] **DEP-044**: On-chain monitoring: alerts when program is upgraded
- [ ] **DEP-045**: Database monitoring: connection pool, query latency, disk usage
- [ ] **DEP-046**: Log aggregation: centralized logging (Datadog, Grafana, CloudWatch, or similar)
- [ ] **DEP-047**: Alert channels: PagerDuty/Slack/Discord for critical alerts

## 13.6 — Disaster Recovery

- [ ] **DEP-048**: Database backups: automated, regular (daily minimum)
- [ ] **DEP-049**: Backup restoration tested (not just backup creation)
- [ ] **DEP-050**: On-chain state: recovery plan if backend database loses sync with on-chain state
- [ ] **DEP-051**: RPG failover: secondary RPC endpoint configured
- [ ] **DEP-052**: Region failover: can the backend be deployed to a different region?
- [ ] **DEP-053**: Contact list: emergency contacts for RPC provider, hosting provider, team members

## 13.7 — Network & DNS

- [ ] **DEP-054**: DNS: DNSSEC enabled if available
- [ ] **DEP-055**: DNS: CAA records restrict which CAs can issue certificates
- [ ] **DEP-056**: No dangling DNS records pointing to deprovisioned infrastructure (subdomain takeover)
- [ ] **DEP-057**: CDN (if used): proper cache invalidation on deploys
- [ ] **DEP-058**: DDoS protection: hosting platform or Cloudflare
- [ ] **DEP-059**: API endpoints not directly exposed (behind reverse proxy or API gateway)

## 13.8 — Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] **DEP-060**: Automated tests run in CI before deploy (all 8 test suites, 258 tests)
- [ ] **DEP-061**: Test environment uses devnet/localnet — NEVER mainnet
- [ ] **DEP-062**: Test wallets are funded from devnet faucet, not from mainnet wallets
- [ ] **DEP-063**: Integration tests cover all critical paths (deposit, withdraw, swap, fee)
- [ ] **DEP-064**: Security tests: fuzzing or property-based testing for program instructions
- [ ] **DEP-065**: Anchor test suite passes with `anchor test` before every deploy
- [ ] **DEP-066**: Test coverage tracked — critical paths have >80% coverage

## 13.9 — CI/CD Pipeline Security

- [ ] **DEP-067**: CI/CD uses pinned action versions with SHA (`actions/checkout@<sha>`) — not floating tags (`@main`, `@latest`); each SHA resolves to a tag or branch of the named action repository rather than an impostor commit from its fork network (`git ls-remote https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` lists it) and carries a matching `# vX.Y.Z` comment; pins are kept current by a Dependabot or Renovate `github-actions` updater (no updater = PARTIAL), because an old pin keeps fixed bugs — in `pull_request_target` / `workflow_run` workflows, `actions/checkout` below v2.8.0 / v3.7.0 / v4.4.0 / v5.1.0 / v6.1.0 lacks the fork-PR guard (DEP-093)
- [ ] **DEP-068**: CI/CD secrets not accessible in builds triggered by pull requests from forks (triggers that run with secrets on fork-originated activity — `pull_request_target`, `workflow_run`, comment / review / issue / discussion events — are checked in §13.13)
- [ ] **DEP-069**: GitHub Actions don't execute attacker-controlled strings: no `${{ github.event.issue.title }}` — or any other event text, branch or file name, commit message, or step output derived from them — in `run:` blocks, `actions/github-script` `script:` or composite-action steps (script injection; sources and sinks in `references/vuln-classes/github-actions.md` §4, recipe R6)
- [ ] **DEP-070**: Third-party CI actions/plugins audited before use — prefer official or verified publishers
- [ ] **DEP-071**: CI pipeline logs don't print secrets (check for `echo $SECRET` or debug output)

## 13.10 — Production Hardening

- [ ] **DEP-072**: Cloud storage buckets (S3, GCS, Azure Blob) are NOT publicly readable or writable — verify with `aws s3 ls` or equivalent
- [ ] **DEP-073**: `.git` directory not accessible in production web server (test: `curl https://domain/.git/HEAD`)
- [ ] **DEP-074**: Backup files (.bak, .sql, .dump, .old, .swp) not accessible via web server
- [ ] **DEP-075**: Docker containers run as non-root user with minimal capabilities and read-only filesystem where possible
- [ ] **DEP-076**: Default credentials changed on ALL services before production deployment (databases, admin panels, queues, caches)
- [ ] **DEP-077**: Subdomain DNS records point to active services — dangling CNAMEs removed to prevent subdomain takeover

## 13.11 — Cloud IaC (GCP / AWS) & Terraform

- [ ] **DEP-080**: Internal services (Cloud Run / Lambda / ECS) are NOT invokable by `allUsers` / anonymous principals — ingress is `internal-and-cloud-load-balancing` (or a VPC-only endpoint), the public API sits behind a load balancer / WAF, and the internal hop is authenticated (IAM invoker role or signed service-to-service tokens)
- [ ] **DEP-081**: Managed databases (Cloud SQL / RDS) have no public IP; access is via private VPC, Auth Proxy or IAM database auth; no `0.0.0.0/0` authorized network
- [ ] **DEP-082**: Runtime secrets are injected from Secret Manager / Parameter Store at deploy or start — not baked into container images, `Dockerfile` `ENV`, or Terraform variables (which end up in state)
- [ ] **DEP-083**: Terraform state is remote (GCS / S3 backend) with encryption and locking; `*.tfstate`, `tfplan*`, `.terraform/` and any binary under `terraform/` are gitignored *and* rejected by a repo-hygiene check — state contains secrets and the full resource inventory
- [ ] **DEP-084**: `terraform apply` runs only from the protected default branch via OIDC / workload-identity federation (no long-lived cloud JSON keys in CI secrets); fork PRs get at most a read-only `plan` and cannot reach cloud credentials
- [ ] **DEP-085**: One service account per service with least privilege — nothing runs as the default compute service account, and no service account holds `roles/editor` / `roles/owner`
- [ ] **DEP-086**: Deploys pin image digests (`@sha256:` not `:latest`), and a rollback workflow (previous-revision traffic split) exists and has been exercised at least once

## 13.12 — Runtime Upgrade & Feature-Gate Readiness (Transaction v1)

- [ ] **DEP-087**: Solana client libraries are at or above the minimum for the runtime features active on the target cluster and are pinned in the lockfile — for transaction v1: `@solana/kit` ≥ 8.0.0, `@solana/web3.js` ≥ 3.0.0-rc.3 (1.x ≥ 1.99.0 read-only), Rust `solana-*` ≥ 4.2, `solders` ≥ 0.29.0, `yellowstone-grpc-proto` ≥ 12.6.0 pinned directly, Yellowstone geyser ≥ 15.1.1, `@triton-one/yellowstone-grpc` ≥ 6.0.0, local validator / CLI ≥ 4.2 or Surfpool ≥ 1.5; generated protobuf stubs are regenerated, not just version-bumped
- [ ] **DEP-088**: Tracked feature gates (e.g. `txv1aq4pp281K9um3tnPgkfX8UqtFT6wcVW3hNezGLL`) are monitored per cluster with an alert on activation; readers and indexers are upgraded **before** the gate activates on the cluster they consume, and the staging validator runs with the gate enabled so the v1 path is exercised pre-mainnet
- [ ] **DEP-089**: Ingress and storage handle the new envelope — relayer / QUIC stream windows accept 4,096-byte transactions, archive and cold-storage read paths round-trip a v1 transaction without downgrading through a v0-only model, and `getSignaturesForAddress`-style paths that are unaffected are documented as such rather than assumed

## 13.13 — GitHub Actions Trigger Trust

> Applies to workflows a non-collaborator can trigger — `issue_comment`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `pull_request_review`, `discussion_comment`, `discussion`, `issues`, `gollum`, `pull_request_target`, `workflow_run` — when the job holds write scopes, secrets, `id-token: write`, an AI agent, or runs PR-controlled code. Playbook: `references/vuln-classes/github-actions.md` (read-only rules of engagement in §0); recipes R1–R8 in `discovery/grep-commands.md`. Mark `[N/A]` when no such workflow exists, and grade an item `[PARTIAL]` while its verdict depends on a hosted setting the source does not show (default token permission, environment reviewers, OIDC trust policy).

- [ ] **DEP-090**: Every job triggered by `issue_comment`, `pull_request_review_comment`, `pull_request_review`, `discussion_comment`, `discussion`, `issues` or `gollum` that holds write scopes, secrets, `id-token: write`, an AI agent or runs PR code gates its job-level `if:` on the triggering object's own `author_association` in {`OWNER`, `MEMBER`, `COLLABORATOR`}, paired per event branch (`comment.*` on comment events, `review.*` on `pull_request_review`, `issue.*` on `issues`, `discussion.*` on `discussion`) and never on an opener field (`issue.` / `pull_request.` / `discussion.author_association`) on a comment or review branch; a mention or command match alone is not a gate, an agent CLI started from `run:` (`claude -p`, `npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code`, `gemini -p`, `codex exec`) has no check of its own, and a job that can deploy or publish (and every `gollum` job, which has no association field) checks the actor's repository permission through the REST API because association is not permission (KV-139; recipes R1–R2)
- [ ] **DEP-091**: Gate comparisons are sound: membership is `==` or `contains(fromJSON('["OWNER","MEMBER","COLLABORATOR"]'), …)`, never string-form `contains('OWNER,MEMBER,…', …)` (a field the event lacks resolves to `''`, which is a substring of every string) and never a deny-list (`!= 'NONE'`, `!contains(fromJSON(…), …)`); `CONTRIBUTOR`, `FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR` and `FIRST_TIMER` are never allowed; on PR-family and `workflow_run` events no trust decision rests on `github.actor` / `github.triggering_actor` (whoever last acted on the event — use `github.event.pull_request.user.login` plus `head.repo.full_name == github.repository`), while on `issue_comment` `github.actor == '<maintainer>'` is a sound allowlist because the actor is the commenter; bot identities in `github.actor` and REST or webhook `login` comparisons are `<slug>[bot]` (only the gh CLI's JSON output renders them as `app/<slug>`) (recipe R3)
- [ ] **DEP-092**: A comment-, review- or label-gated job that checks out or executes PR code binds the commit that was approved — `github.event.review.commit_id` on `pull_request_review`, `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` on a labeled `pull_request_target`, and on `issue_comment` (whose payload has no `pull_request` object, so `github.event.pull_request.head.sha` is empty) a SHA named in the command that the job checks out exactly and rejects unless it is still the PR head — never `refs/pull/<n>/head`, `head_ref` or a branch name resolved after approval (KV-139 step 5; recipe R7)
- [ ] **DEP-093**: No `pull_request_target` or `workflow_run` job holding write scopes, secrets, OIDC or a deploy path checks out or executes fork-controlled code — no `ref:` to the PR head or merge commit or to `workflow_run.head_branch` / `head_sha`, no `repository: …head.repo.full_name`, no `git fetch … pull/<n>/…` or `gh pr checkout`, no `allow-unsafe-pr-checkout: true`, and no build or install entry point over such code (`npm|yarn|pnpm install`, `pip install` / `pip download` of an sdist, `cargo build` / `build-sbf` → `build.rs` and proc-macros, `anchor build|test` → `Anchor.toml` `[hooks]` / `[scripts]`, `make`, `uses: ./…`); FAIL when PR code is checked out or executed, PASS for a job that checks out only the base ref, PARTIAL when such a job pins `actions/checkout` below the fork-PR guard (v2.8.0 / v3.7.0 / v4.4.0 / v5.1.0 / v6.1.0 / v7.0.0) (KV-140; recipe R7)
- [ ] **DEP-094**: `workflow_run` consumers treat the triggering run as attacker-authored: artifacts are downloaded into `$RUNNER_TEMP`, parsed and validated as data (e.g. a numeric PR number) and never executed, sourced, unpacked over the checkout or written to `$GITHUB_ENV` / `$GITHUB_PATH`; gates use `github.event.workflow_run.event` and `github.event.workflow_run.head_repository.full_name == github.repository`, never `workflow_run.head_branch == 'main'` (a fork branch can carry that name) or `github.repository` (always the base repository on this trigger) (KV-140; recipe R4)
- [ ] **DEP-095**: No value derived from event data, artifacts or untrusted step outputs is written to `$GITHUB_ENV` or `$GITHUB_PATH` in a privileged workflow (`>>`, `tee -a`, `core.exportVariable`, `core.addPath`) — a newline in it defines any variable for every later step, `BASH_ENV` and `LD_PRELOAD` turn that into code execution, and the runner blocks only `NODE_OPTIONS`; multiline `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` / `$GITHUB_ENV` writes use a random per-run delimiter or a file, and event-derived step outputs reach `run:` / `script:` only through a quoted `env:` variable (recipes R5–R6)
- [ ] **DEP-096**: Release, publish and deploy jobs restore no GitHub Actions cache (`actions/cache`, `setup-*` `cache:`) that a job running untrusted code in default-branch context can write — `pull_request_target`, `issue_comment`, `issues`, `discussion*`, `workflow_run` and agent jobs all save into the default branch's cache scope, and the 10 GB eviction lets them replace existing entries (Ultralytics 2024, Clinejection 2026; KV-140 step 6)
