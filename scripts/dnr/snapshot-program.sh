#
# $RPC_URL must already be exported (never typed on the command line). Run it from
# the installation, never as a relative scripts/ path: the audited repo may ship a
# same-named file.
#
# Why first: a hotfix upgrade overwrites the on-chain ELF. If the team ships a fix
# while the hunt is running, the incident binary is gone, and Leg 3 of
# `confirmed_exploited` (a PoC on the real bytes) can no longer be met. So step 1 of
# /auditor:hunt and /auditor:respond runs this for every implicated program, before
# any collection or analysis.
#
# What it does (read-only — no signing, and no keypair the CLI could sign with):
#   1. writes a throwaway CLI config in a private temp dir (mode 0700, removed on
#      exit): `json_rpc_url` is $RPC_URL, so the URL never appears in argv, and
#      `keypair_path` names a file that does not exist. `solana config get keypair`
#      must report that path back, or the CLI fell back to its defaults and the
#      script stops with a blocker.
#   2. `solana -C <config> program show <id>` into the temp dir (with a fixed
#      `--buffer-authority`, so the CLI never looks for a signer). It rejects a
#      loader-v4 program as "not an SBF program"; that one is read with
#      `program-v4 show --program-id <id>` (a fixed `--authority`, for the same
#      reason), and an account neither command reads stops with a blocker.
#   3. `solana -C <config> program dump <id>` (loader-v4: `program-v4 download
#      --program-id <id>`) into the temp dir, then `show` again: the slot and the
#      bytes come from separate reads, so a slot that moved means a deploy landed
#      in between. The dump is then taken once more, and a slot that moves again
#      stops the script with a blocker.
#   4. checks the ELF magic, hashes the dump the way solana-verify does (trailing
#      zero padding trimmed, then sha256), keeps the dump and the show output in
#      <incident_dir>/bin/, and prints ONE ledger-ready line:
#        program=<id> owner=<loader> last_deployed_slot=<N> authority=<A>
#        sha256_zero_trimmed=<hex> elf_bytes=<n> padding_bytes=<n> file=bin/<id>.so
#      A program under an immutable loader (BPFLoader2, or the older BPFLoader) has
#      no deploy slot and no authority: last_deployed_slot=n/a (immutable loader).
#
# NEVER OVERWRITTEN: the first snapshot is bin/<id>.so + bin/<id>.show.txt, the
# incident-time bytes that Leg 3 and the patch flow run on. A later run (respond
# runs this again after the hunt) compares the program on-chain with every
# snapshot already in bin/:
#   * the same last-deployed slot and zero-trimmed sha256 as one of them: it prints
#     "unchanged" and that snapshot's line, writes nothing, and exits 0;
#   * otherwise it keeps the current bytes as bin/<id>@<slot>.so and
#     bin/<id>@<slot>.show.txt, and prints the first snapshot's line and the new one.
# Files are written with noclobber (`set -C`): a name already taken stops the
# script with a blocker instead of being replaced.
#
# Compare `last_deployed_slot` to the incident slot: earlier → this dump IS the
# incident binary (binary_provenance: dumped-unchanged); later → a newer upgrade
# replaced it (dumped-after-hotfix; the incident bytes need an archived binary or a
# solana-verify hash-matched build).
#
# RUN DIRECTORY: <incident_dir>, and the nearest incident_* directory above it, must
# not be a symbolic link, hold one, or be tracked by git; such a directory is refused
# with exit 2 before anything is written or the CLI runs.
#
# SECRETS: the CLI reads "$RPC_URL" from the temp config, never from argv; an
# $RPC_URL holding a quote, a backslash, whitespace or a control character is refused.
# The CLI's stderr is captured to a temp file and passed through redact.sh (the CLI
# echoes the full URL, key included, in its errors). Nothing written to
# <incident_dir> contains the URL.
#
# Exit: 0 ok · 2 usage / not a base58 32-byte public key / no or unusable $RPC_URL /
# a refused run directory · 3 named blocker (no solana CLI or python3, config not
# taken, CLI error or no program under any loader, dump without ELF magic, the
# last-deployed slot moving during two dumps, hash not computed, a snapshot name
# already taken).
# bash >= 3.2, and python3 for the id check and the hash: checked before the CLI
