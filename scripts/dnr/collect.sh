# collect.sh — the ONE gated collector for the detection & response track. Pages
# signature history for one or more addresses and fetches each transaction, into a
# local JSONL corpus. Besides snapshot-program.sh (one program account, via the
# solana CLI), it is the only recipe in the track that touches the network.

#   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dnr/collect.sh" --out <dir> --confirmed \

#
# $RPC_URL must already be exported; never type the URL on the command line. Run it
# from the installation, never as a relative scripts/ path: the audited repo may
# ship a same-named file.
#
# GATING (do not relax — this is how "plans only, no actions" stays true for the
# corpus collection):
#   * REFUSES unless --confirmed is passed. `/auditor:hunt` and `/auditor:respond`
#     pass it only AFTER showing the human the addresses, the window, the caps and
#     the estimated call count, and getting a yes. Without it the script exits 2
#     before any network call.
#   * READ-ONLY RPC only: getSignaturesForAddress and getTransaction. Never a send,
#     a simulate, or a write method.
#   * CAPPED: --max-pages (default 20 → up to 20000 signatures per address) and
#     --max-tx (default 2000) bound the work and the spend. Raise them deliberately.
#     --max-tx counts getTransaction calls, failed ones included, so a run makes at
#     most addresses × max-pages + max-tx calls.
#   * STOPS ON A FAILING ENDPOINT: after 10 getTransaction calls in a row fail
#     (rate limit, outage, or history the endpoint does not serve), it fetches
#     nothing more and records the stop as a collection gap.
#
# WHAT IS KEPT: every signature in the window, FAILED ones included. A failed
# transaction moves no state, but it is evidence of an attempt — probing before a
# success, or a `suspected` incident whose attack has not landed yet. Filtering
# failures out would make those undetectable. Use `meta.err` downstream.
#
# RUN DIRECTORY: --out is a plain path, with no . or .. component, and no directory on
# its way may be a symbolic link inside the working directory (a link above it, such
# as /tmp on macOS, is the operator's). --out, and the nearest incident_* directory
# above it, must be a directory this run may write into: either one that is a symbolic
# link, holds a symbolic link, is tracked by git, or that git or find cannot check is
# refused with exit 2 before anything is written or sent.
#
# --before <sig> starts paging just older than that signature (resume a capped run,
# or skip activity newer than the incident) — always into a new --out: an --out that
# already holds signatures.jsonl, transactions.jsonl or collection-gaps.tsv, even an
# empty one, is refused, and the script creates its files with noclobber (`set -C`),
# so a resume never erases the first pass. It writes them only through the
# descriptors opened when it created them, and reads the signature list back from a
# private copy. Every address and --before value must be base58, and every number a
# plain integer, before anything is written or sent.
#
# PAGING: an empty page is the end of the address's history, and so is a page that
# crosses --since. A page shorter than the 1000 signatures asked for is not, except
# on the last page --max-pages allows: a node can return a short page before the end
# (for example when its archive backend fails), so paging goes on. That costs one
# more call when the history did end there, never more calls than --max-pages. When
# the page cap stops paging on a full page before --since was crossed, whatever
# --since and --until are, the script says so ("older history may exist") with the
# --before to resume from: the corpus may then be incomplete for that address, a
# collection gap to record in the ledger. Signatures are fetched newest first (by
# slot, across all addresses; within a slot, in the order the RPC returned them), so
# --max-tx drops the oldest. The script runs under LC_ALL=C, so neither that order
# nor any character range depends on the caller's locale.
#
# COLLECTION GAPS: every gap is also a row of <dir>/collection-gaps.tsv,
# `<signature or address><TAB><reason>`: a getTransaction that failed (transport
# error, RPC error or null result), a signature page that failed, a page cap that
# stopped on a full page (older history may exist), the --max-tx cap, and the stop
# on a failing endpoint (the last two name the first signature not fetched). The
# run ends with "transactions fetched: N of M calls -> <dir>/transactions.jsonl" and
# "collection gaps: N (see <dir>/collection-gaps.tsv)". Gaps leave the exit status at
# 0; copy each row into LEDGER.md and INCIDENTS.json `collection_gaps`.
#
# INTERRUPTED: an INT, TERM or HUP ends the run with the same record. The address
# being paged and each address after it, and the signatures listed but not fetched
# (one row naming the first), become gap rows; the closing lines are printed; the
# exit status is 128 + the signal number (130, 143, 129). A run killed outright
# (SIGKILL) writes nothing more: then each signature in signatures.jsonl with no
# transaction in transactions.jsonl, and each address past the last one paged, is a
# gap. A run makes up to addresses × --max-pages + --max-tx calls, each up to 60 s,
# so run a long one in the background, or with a timeout sized from that count.
#
# SECRETS: the endpoint comes from $RPC_URL and is NEVER echoed. curl runs with -q
# (no ~/.curlrc) and reads the URL from a config on stdin (-K -), so the key stays
# out of its argv; an $RPC_URL holding a quote, a backslash, whitespace or a control
# character is refused. curl's stderr is captured to a temp file and passed through
# redact.sh. Output files carry no URL, and the "provider" line carries the host's
# last two DNS labels only, since some providers put an endpoint token in a
# subdomain.
#
# Transactions are fetched jsonParsed, commitment finalized, with
# maxSupportedTransactionVersion:1 — mandatory, since v1 transactions are live on
# mainnet and a v1 fetch without the opt-in returns RPC error -32015.
#
# EXACT INTEGERS: lamport balances and jsonParsed amounts pass 2^53, and jq < 1.7
# re-encodes every number as a double. jq writes transactions.jsonl only when it
# keeps a 2^64-1 literal exact; otherwise `python3 -I` does (its json module keeps
# integers exact), one compact JSON object per line either way. Signature pages
# carry only slots, block times and small error codes, and jq writes them.
#
# Exit: 0 done (collection gaps included) · 2 usage, a refused input, $RPC_URL, run
# directory, or an --out that holds a corpus file or where they cannot be created · 3
# named blocker (no curl or jq; a jq that rounds large integers and no working
