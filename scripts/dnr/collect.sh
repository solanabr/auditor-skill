# collect.sh — the ONE gated collector for the detection & response track. Pages
# signature history for one or more addresses and fetches each transaction, into a
# local JSONL corpus. Besides snapshot-program.sh (one program account, via the
# solana CLI), it is the only recipe in the track that touches the network.
#
#   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dnr/collect.sh" --out <dir> --confirmed \
#        [--since <unix>] [--until <unix>] [--before <signature>] \
#        [--max-pages N] [--max-tx N] -- <address> [<address> ...]
#
# $RPC_URL must already be exported; never type the URL on the command line. Run it
# from the installation, never as a relative scripts/ path: the audited repo may
# ship a same-named file.
#
# GATING (do not relax — this is how "plans only, no actions" stays true for the
# corpus collection):
#   * REFUSES unless --confirmed is passed. `/auditor:hunt` and `/auditor:respond`
#     pass it only AFTER showing the human the addresses, the window, the caps and
#     the estimated call count, and getting a yes. Without it the script exits 2
#     before any network call.
#   * READ-ONLY RPC only: getSignaturesForAddress and getTransaction. Never a send,
#     a simulate, or a write method.
#   * CAPPED: --max-pages (default 20 → up to 20000 signatures per address) and
#     --max-tx (default 2000) bound the work and the spend. Raise them deliberately.
#     --max-tx counts getTransaction calls, failed ones included, so a run makes at
#     most addresses × max-pages + max-tx calls.
#   * STOPS ON A FAILING ENDPOINT: after 10 getTransaction calls in a row fail
#     (rate limit, outage, or history the endpoint does not serve), it fetches
#     nothing more and records the stop as a collection gap.
#
# WHAT IS KEPT: every signature in the window, FAILED ones included. A failed
# transaction moves no state, but it is evidence of an attempt — probing before a
# success, or a `suspected` incident whose attack has not landed yet. Filtering
# failures out would make those undetectable. Use `meta.err` downstream.
#
# RUN DIRECTORY: --out, and the nearest incident_* directory at or above it, must be
# a directory this run may write into. Either one that is a symbolic link, holds a
# symbolic link, or is tracked by git is refused with exit 2 before anything is
# written or sent.
#
# --before <sig> starts paging just older than that signature (resume a capped run,
# or skip activity newer than the incident) — always into a new --out: an --out that
# already holds signatures.jsonl, transactions.jsonl or collection-gaps.tsv, even an
# empty one, is refused, and the script creates its files with noclobber (`set -C`),
# so a resume never erases the first pass. Every address and --before value must be
# base58, and every number a plain integer, before anything is written or sent.
#
# A page shorter than the 1000 signatures asked for is the end of the address's
# history. When the page cap stops paging on a full page before --since was crossed,
# whatever --since and --until are, the script says so ("history truncated") with
# the --before to resume from: the corpus is then incomplete for that address, a
# collection gap to record in the ledger. Signatures are fetched newest first (by
# slot, across all addresses; within a slot, in the order the RPC returned them), so
# --max-tx drops the oldest. The script runs under LC_ALL=C, so neither that order
# nor any character range depends on the caller's locale.
#
# COLLECTION GAPS: every gap is also a row of <dir>/collection-gaps.tsv,
# `<signature or address><TAB><reason>`: a getTransaction that failed (transport
# error, RPC error or null result), a signature page that failed, history the page
# cap truncated, the --max-tx cap, and the stop on a failing endpoint (the
# last two name the first signature not fetched). The run ends with
# "collection gaps: N (see <dir>/collection-gaps.tsv)". Gaps leave the exit status
# at 0; copy each row into LEDGER.md and INCIDENTS.json `collection_gaps`.
#
# SECRETS: the endpoint comes from $RPC_URL and is NEVER echoed. curl runs with -q
# (no ~/.curlrc) and reads the URL from a config on stdin (-K -), so the key stays
# out of its argv; an $RPC_URL holding a quote, a backslash, whitespace or a control
# character is refused. curl's stderr is captured to a temp file and passed through
# redact.sh. Output files carry no URL, and the "provider" line carries the host's
# last two DNS labels only, since some providers put an endpoint token in a
# subdomain.
#
# Transactions are fetched jsonParsed, commitment finalized, with
# maxSupportedTransactionVersion:1 — mandatory, since v1 transactions are live on
# mainnet and a v1 fetch without the opt-in returns RPC error -32015.
#
# EXACT INTEGERS: lamport balances and jsonParsed amounts pass 2^53, and jq < 1.7
# re-encodes every number as a double. jq writes transactions.jsonl only when it
# keeps a 2^64-1 literal exact; otherwise `python3 -I` does (its json module keeps
# integers exact), one compact JSON object per line either way. Signature pages
# carry only slots, block times and small error codes, and jq writes them.
#
# Exit: 0 done (collection gaps included) · 2 usage, a refused input, $RPC_URL, run
# directory or --out · 3 named blocker (no curl or jq; a jq that rounds large
# integers and no working python3).
# bash >= 3.2, curl, jq (and python3 with jq < 1.7). Output: <dir>/signatures.jsonl,
# <dir>/transactions.jsonl, <dir>/collection-gaps.tsv.

# -C (noclobber): no redirection in this script replaces an existing file.
