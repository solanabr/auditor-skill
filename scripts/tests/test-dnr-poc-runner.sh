#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-dnr-poc-runner.sh — self-test for templates/poc/run.sh and the PoC contract
# assertions in templates/poc/shared-test-utils:
#   * the execution mode every run needs (without AUDITOR_EXEC_MODE=isolated|native it
#     exits 3 before anything is copied or compiled, whatever the crate holds), and the
#     same gate, shown verbatim in the docs, for the runners poc-engineer writes;
#   * prebuilt bytes: VULNERABLE_SO alone runs the exploit arm, FIXED_SO adds the
#     fixed arm and needs VULNERABLE_SO; an arm counts only on the marker its contract
#     assertion leaves when it runs and holds; a fixed arm that fails on a harness
#     error is inconclusive (exit 3); success prints the Leg 3 line with the
#     zero-trimmed hashes (computed with `python3 -I`, so a hashlib.py in the working
#     directory never loads);
#   * verdicts: a failed test is exit 1 / 2 only when a contract assertion ran and did
#     not hold; one that failed before any assertion ran (the program did not load,
#     the setup panicked) or after every assertion held is inconclusive (exit 3);
#   * the bytes that ran: an arm counts only when every program mollusk_for loaded is
#     the .so run.sh placed, unchanged after the test, and the Leg 3 line names it;
#   * the deployed-hotfix check holds only with its positive control: a legitimate
#     call that goes through on the same bytes and changes the account;
#   * where the crate builds (always a scratch copy outside the target tree with a
#     pinned toolchain; a crate holding a symbolic link, .cargo/, rust-toolchain* or
#     tests/fixtures/<crate>.so is refused; BPF_OUT_DIR is cleared; an inherited
#     CARGO_TARGET_DIR is honoured), and the exit codes (a failed build is 3, a failed
#     verdict 1/2);
#   * dependency pins: the crate's Cargo.lock is what resolves; a crate without one
#     gets a line saying so; UPDATE_PINS moves only the named pins, with cargo update
#     -p in the scratch copy before anything is built, and refuses any other entry;
#   * the patch verification recipe (templates/patch/VERIFICATION.md §1): its worktree
#     is made in a Rule 11c copy, and no git runs in the client checkout.
#
# No Solana toolchain and no network needed. A temp copy of run.sh runs with a `cargo`
# shim, or with a PATH that has no cargo at all. When real cargo and rustup are
# present, the template's own tests/exploit.rs and tests/fixed_blocked.rs and its
# shared-test-utils are built and run through run.sh against small stand-in crates
# (mollusk-svm, solana-sdk, borsh, ...) whose program behaviour is the text after the
# ELF magic in the prebuilt .so: path dependencies only, offline. bash >= 3.2; uses
# only standard POSIX tools + python3. Exits non-zero if any assertion fails.

# cargo shim + a PATH with the shim first. The shim logs the two lookups that make an
# in-tree build dangerous, the way cargo and rustup do them: a .cargo/config.toml in
# the working directory or any parent (the user's CARGO_HOME excepted), and a
# rust-toolchain.toml there when RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN is not pinned. With SHIM_CALLS set it
# also logs every call, tab-separated: working directory, CARGO_TARGET_DIR,
# SBF_OUT_DIR, BPF_OUT_DIR, AUDITOR_POC_MARKERS, arguments. A test run (not --no-run)
# leaves the markers SHIM_MARKERS names for its test (<test>:<kind>), as
# shared-test-utils does: by default those of a PoC whose assertions all ran and held
# on the placed bytes, and none for SHIM_MARKERS=none. Kind `loaded` records the
# zero-trimmed hash of the .so in SBF_OUT_DIR, as mollusk_for does; `loaded-other`
# records other bytes; `tamper` changes the placed .so. SHIM_FAIL makes one step fail
# with cargo's own exit code, 101.
