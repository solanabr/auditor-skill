PERSISTED INTAKE ARTIFACT
================================================================================
Written by /intake (alias /scope) to audit_<n>/intake.md. This is the persisted
form of QUESTIONS.md — the passive questionnaire turned into a durable file that
BOTH flows read (audit-cycle applies defaults; audit-assist asks the human).
Fixes "answers live only in conversation state."

FEEDS THE REPORT:
  - Scope / commit / languages / effort   -> §2 Scope & Engagement (2.1-2.4)
  - Trust-model inputs                     -> §4.4 Trust Model & Actors, §4.6 Assumptions
  - Severity calibration                   -> §5 Severity Classification (deployment/TVL levers)
  - Assumed defaults (unanswered)          -> §4.6 Assumptions & Simplifications

HOW TO USE:
  1. Copy to audit_<n>/intake.md. Fill every {placeholder}.
  2. Interactive flow (/intake): ASK each unanswered question, record the answer.
  3. Auto flow (audit-cycle): apply the QUESTIONS.md default, and record it under
     "Assumed Defaults (Unanswered)" with the exact default applied — never leave
     a field blank and never silently assume.
  4. Every assumption recorded here MUST surface in the report's §4.6. A default
     applied here is a stated assumption there, not a hidden one.

## 1. Scope & Commit Pin

<!-- Feeds report §2.1-2.3. Pin the commit so the report names exactly what was reviewed. -->

| | |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository**      | {path or URL}                                     |

| **Scope**           | {FULL / PROGRAM / BACKEND / FRONTEND / DEVOPS}    |
| **In scope**        | {paths / programs / dirs reviewed}                |
| **Out of scope**    | {excluded paths + reason — Q44} |

| **Collects PII**        | {no — wallets only / email / KYC / financial} (Q36) |
| **Compliance checklist**| {checklist 18 on / off} |

---

## 5. Severity Calibration

<!--
The deployment/TVL levers that shift severity (Rule 1 Impact x Likelihood).
Feeds report §5 and every finding's severity derivation. Q8, Q10, Q11, Q40-Q41.
Record the concrete calibration rule applied, not just the answer.
-->

| | |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Deployment status**     | {pre-launch / devnet / mainnet-live} (Q8)  |
| **TVL / funds at risk**   | {$0 / <$10K / $10K-100K / $100K-1M / $1M-10M / >$10M} (Q10) |
| **Upgradeable**           | {single wallet / multisig / DAO / immutable / N/A} (Q11) |
| **Top concerns (ranked)** | {1. … / 2. … / 3. …} (Q40)                 |
| **Audit depth**           | {quick / standard / deep / maximum} (Q41)  |

**Calibration rules applied**

<!-- Translate the answers into the concrete severity adjustment (see QUESTIONS.md
     "How Answers Affect the Audit"). Each is a lever the report's §5 will cite. -->

- {Q8 = mainnet-live → +1 severity on all fund-related findings.}
- {Q10 > $1M → critical findings double-weighted in risk score.}
- {Q11 = single wallet → upgrade authority auto-flagged Severity 8+.}
- {Q41 = quick → grep + known-vectors only, semantic analysis skipped (state as coverage limit).}

---

## 6. Trust-Model Inputs (CRITICAL)

<!--
The load-bearing section. WHO is trusted — the inputs that seed report §4.4
(Trust Model & Actors) and §4.6 (Assumptions & Simplifications), and that
/threat-model expands into the actor x capability table. A finding gated by a
trusted role is capped in severity BECAUSE of what is recorded here; if an entry
is "untrusted", a bypass by that actor is a full-severity finding.

For each: name who holds it, what they can do, and what the review TRUSTS them
NOT to do. "Untrusted / permissionless" is a valid and important answer.
-->

| Actor | Who / how gated | Trusted to (privileges) | Trusted NOT to |
| ----- | --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
| **Upgrade authority** | {single wallet / multisig / DAO / immutable} (Q11) | {upgrade program} | {push a malicious upgrade; assumed key-secure} |
| **Admin / manager**   | {wallet sig / admin JWT / on-chain authority} (Q16) | {set params, pause, …} | {abuse privileged ops; assumed honest} |
| **Oracle**            | {Pyth / Switchboard / custom} (Q23) | {supply price} | {report manipulated / stale price beyond bounds} |
| **Keeper / crank**    | {who runs it} | {trigger scheduled ops} | {reorder / withhold to grief} |
| **LP / depositor**    | {permissionless} | {deposit, withdraw own} | — (untrusted) |
| **Permissionless user** | {anyone} | {call open instructions} | — (untrusted — the attacker) |

**Trust-model narrative** — {2-4 sentences: the security of the system depends on
which of the above holding. State the load-bearing ones plainly. This is the seed
text for report §4.6.}

---

## 7. Security History

<!-- Q25-Q28. Feeds methodology / prior-fix assumptions. Q25 = first audit -> no
     assumptions about prior fixes; enables deeper analysis. -->

| | |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Prior audits**        | {firm name / internal / tools only / first audit} (Q25) |
| **Incidents**           | {fund loss / blocked exploit / breach / none} (Q26) |
| **Bug bounty**          | {public / private / none} (Q27) |

---

## 8. Assumed Defaults (Unanswered)

<!--
MANDATORY when any question was not answered by a human (the norm for the auto
flow). For each unanswered item, record the QUESTIONS.md default that was applied
and note it will appear as a stated assumption in report §4.6. Never leave a field
blank; never silently assume. The interactive flow SHOULD leave this section empty
(everything was asked) — if it is non-empty in interactive mode, list what the
human explicitly deferred.
-->

| Field (Q#) | Default applied | Basis |
| ---------- | --------------- | ----- |
| {Q10 TVL — unanswered} | {assumed "Unknown" → severity calibrated to pre-launch baseline} | QUESTIONS.md default |
| {Q11 upgradeable — unanswered} | {assumed present; upgrade authority treated as trusted-but-single unless code shows otherwise} | QUESTIONS.md default |
| {Q23 oracle — unanswered} | {assumed no oracle unless code shows a feed} | inferred from code |
| {…} | {…} | {…} |

> Every default listed here is carried into the report's **§4.6 Assumptions &
> Simplifications** as an explicit assumption — so "no finding here" reads against
> the stated default rather than as a blanket clearance.
