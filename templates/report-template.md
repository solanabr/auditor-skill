## 2. Scope Coverage

> Which checklists and vector groups were in scope, and how many items were evaluated. Out-of-scope items render `[N/A — out of scope]` from the scope gate (Rule 0), not from reading each file.

| Checklist / vector group | In scope? | Items evaluated / total | Trigger / reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01–07 on-chain | Yes/No | N / N | `.rs` / `Anchor.toml` |
| 08–10 off-chain (TS/web) | Yes/No | N / N | `.ts` / `.tsx` |
| 14 python | Yes/No | N / N | `.py` |
| 15 general language | Yes/No | N / N | `.go`/`.java`/`.rb`/`.php` |
| 19 AI-agent | Yes/No | N / N | `.mcp.json` / agent SDK |
| 20 off-chain Rust | Yes/No | N / N | `.rs` outside `programs/` |
| 11–13, 16–18 universal | Yes | N / N | any repo |

### Scope Metrics
