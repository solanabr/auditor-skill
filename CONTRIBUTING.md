# Contributing to auditor-skill

auditor-skill is a markdown security-audit corpus plus a small amount of tooling. Contributions are
welcome — new known vectors, checklist items, protocol methodologies, fixes to wording, and tooling
improvements. This document is the short version of "how a change gets in".

---

## 1. Ground rules

- **Nothing lands on `main` directly.** Every change — maintainers included — goes through a branch and a
  pull request that is reviewed by someone other than its author. `main` is protected.
- **One theme per PR.** A PR adds *one* coherent thing (a vector, a methodology, a checklist section, a
  tooling change). Split unrelated changes; reviewers cannot meaningfully review a 3,000-line mixed diff.
- **Counts must stay consistent.** Item and vector totals are hardcoded in several files (see §4). CI runs
  `scripts/check-corpus.sh` and fails the PR if any of them disagree with the files on disk.
- **No AI-attribution trailers in commits or PRs.** Commits and PR descriptions must not carry
  `Co-Authored-By: … Claude/Anthropic`, "Generated with …", or similar trailers. A `commit-msg` hook that
  enforces this ships in `scripts/hooks/` (enable it with the command in §2) and CI re-checks every commit
  in the PR range. Using AI tooling to help write a contribution is fine; the author of record is the
  human who opens the PR and takes responsibility for the content.
- **Security issues in this repository** (install script, Rust tools, workflows, or corpus content that
  could mislead an auditor into a dangerous action) go through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not a public
  issue.

## 2. Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/solanabr/auditor-skill.git
cd auditor-skill
git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks      # enables the attribution-trailer commit-msg hook
bash scripts/check-corpus.sh                 # should print "ok" lines and exit 0 on a clean tree
```

Optional: `git submodule update --init --recursive` for the vendored Trail of Bits tooling and
`cd tools/auditor-tools && cargo build --release` for the Rust CLIs. Neither is needed for corpus PRs.

---

## 3. Branch and PR flow

1. Branch from an up-to-date `main`:
   `git switch -c feat/<topic>-<dd-mm-yyyy>` (prefixes in use: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `perf/`, `chore/`).
2. Make the change. Run `bash scripts/check-corpus.sh` before every commit that touches
   `checklists/`, `known-vectors/`, `references/methodologies/`, or any file that quotes a count.
3. Commit with a conventional-style subject and a body that says *what* and *why*:
   `feat(corpus): <what> — <why>`, `fix(vector): …`, `docs(readme): …`, `chore(release): bump version to X.Y.Z`.
4. Push the branch and open a PR against `main` using the template. Fill in every section; "n/a" is an
   acceptable answer, an empty section is not.
5. Address review. Prefer new commits over force-pushes during review so reviewers can see what changed.
6. A maintainer merges. Stacked PRs (a branch based on another open PR branch) are fine — say so in the
   description and merge them in order.

Version bumps are their own `chore(release)` PR (or the last commit of a release PR) — content PRs update
counts but leave the version alone, so several content PRs can be open at once without conflicting on the
version line.

## 4. Adding corpus content

### A known vector

1. Create `known-vectors/NNN-short-name.md` with the next free number. Never renumber existing vectors —
   ranges like `KV-001..NNN` are quoted across the corpus and third-party reports reference the ids.
2. Follow the existing format exactly (see any recent file, e.g. `131-…` or `134-…`):
   YAML frontmatter (`id`, `title`, `severity`, `category`) → `### NNN — Title` → `**Severity: N** | **Real: …**`
   → description → cross-ref block → `#### Verification Procedure` with numbered steps, each with a grep /
   check and ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL lines → `**Overall verdict:**` with ✅ / ⚠️ / ❌ / N/A.
3. Add a row to `known-vectors/INDEX.md` in the right section with a **Load when (markers)** cell
   (default to `always (<phase>)` unless the vector is provably feature-specific), and update the totals at
   the bottom of the index (`Total vector files`, `Distinct concepts`, the per-version tally).
4. Bump the vector count in every file that quotes it: `SKILL.md` (description + header + "up to N"),
   `README.md`, `FULL-AUDIT.md`, `COSTS.md`, `OUTPUT-RULES.md`, `templates/report-template.md`,
   `docs/README.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. `scripts/check-corpus.sh`
   tells you which ones you missed.
5. If the vector is feature-gated, add a row to the advisory table in
   `references/orchestration/pre-scan.md` and, when useful, a grep block in `discovery/grep-commands.md`.

### Checklist items

1. Append to the relevant `checklists/NN-*.md` using the file's id prefix and the **next sequential number**
   (ids are never reused, even if an item is removed). New sections get the next `NN.x` heading.
2. Update the per-checklist counts in `SKILL.md` (Checklists Reference table) and `README.md` (Supported
   Languages table and the folder-structure listing), the totals everywhere the item total is quoted
   (`SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `COSTS.md`, `docs/README.md`, `templates/audit-report.md`,
   `templates/report-template.md`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`), and the `...through XX-NNN` line for that
   checklist in `templates/report-template.md`.

### A protocol methodology

1. Create `references/methodologies/<name>.md` following the shape of the existing playbooks: a
   *Load when* block with grep markers, a *Purpose* paragraph, numbered sections (classify first → threat
   model / per-mechanism table → invariant catalog → worksheets → high-density surfaces → detection recipes →
   test / PoC strategy) and a fast-pass checklist at the end.
2. Register it: a row in the `SKILL.md` reference-loading table, a row in the pre-scan advisory table, the
   methodology count and list in `README.md` (two places) and `docs/README.md`, and — if it adds invariants a
   harness can assert — a section in `references/invariant-catalog.md`.

### Wording, evidence and honesty

- Every claim of a real incident must be a public, verifiable one (post-mortem, audit report, advisory).
  Say "class of bug" when you cannot cite an incident. Do not invent dollar figures.
- Items are **verification steps**, not advice: an auditor must be able to mark each one PASS / FAIL / N/A
  from the code. If it cannot be checked, it does not belong in a checklist.
- Prefer grep-able markers and exact identifiers over prose.

## 5. Tooling changes

`tools/auditor-tools` (Rust) and `scripts/` have their own conventions: keep `cargo build --release`
warning-free, add or extend a fixture under the tool's test directory for any parser change, and document
new flags in `docs/power-tools.md`. Workflow files pin third-party actions to a full commit SHA with the
version in a trailing comment.

---

## 6. Review checklist (what a reviewer looks for)

- Does the change do one thing, and is that thing described accurately in the PR?
- Do all counts, index rows, and reference-table rows agree (`scripts/check-corpus.sh` green)?
- Are new vectors / items checkable from code, with a PASS / FAIL shape and a grep?
- Are cited incidents real and public?
- No attribution trailers, no secrets, no `.env` / state / local assistant files tracked.
